Clinical efficacy of Avène hydrotherapy measured in a large cohort of more than 10,000 atopic or psoriatic patients
Atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis are chronic skin conditions. Local or systemic treatments are effective, but their effects are transient. Hydrotherapy, used alone or in combination with other treatments, could be considered as one form of care in providing effective management of these dermatoses. The objective of this observational study was to evaluate the benefit of a 3-week treatment at Avène Hydrotherapy Centre in a very large cohort of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and to assess the treatment benefits on patients undergoing hydrotherapy for two consecutive years. This 8-year observational study analysed 14,328 records of patients having a dermatological disease and who came to Avène Hydrotherapy Centre for a 3-week treatment between 2001 and 2009. Among them, patients were suffering from atopic dermatitis (n = 5916) and psoriasis (n = 4887). On admission on D0 (day 0) and at the end of cure on D18 (day 18), the severity of AD and psoriasis were evaluated by SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), respectively. In order to assess the cumulative effect of the hydrotherapy treatment, the evolution of SCORAD or PASI of patients who came 2 years in a row was also calculated. A significant improvement in SCORAD was observed between D0 and D18 (-41.6%) (P < 0.0001) and similarly, a significant reduction in PASI was noted between D0 and D18 (-54.4%) (P < 0.0001) after 3-weeks of hydrotherapy. PASI 50 and PASI 75 were 64.3% and 19.5%, respectively. For atopic patients (n = 1102) or patients suffering from psoriasis (n = 833) who came for two consecutive years, a significant SCORAD and PASI improvement was observed on D0 of the second year when compared with D0 of the previous year (P < 0.0001). This study is the first observational study in such a large cohort demonstrating the benefit of a 3-week treatment at the Avène Hydrotherapy Centre for atopic and psoriatic patients.
