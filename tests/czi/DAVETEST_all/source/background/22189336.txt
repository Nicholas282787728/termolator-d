We examined a yearly change of the relationship between the place of death and the activity of home care supporting clinics(HCSC)in Tokyo, Japan. The number of HCSCs by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare has edged up slightly from 1, 166 in 2008 to 1, 246 in 2010. The number of total patients provided the care by HCSC has increased by 24. 4% from 2009 to 2010. There was a 9. 3% increase in the patients provided the care by HCSC, and died at home from 2009 to 2010. These results suggested that the home care support system has proceeded gradually in Tokyo, Japan.
