Tumor necrosis factor and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID). As a result, the inhibition of TNF is an important therapeutic avenue in the treatment of these pathophysiologically diverse disease states. This section discusses TNF, its receptors, and its role in immunoregulation and inflammation, as well as the currently available anti-TNF-based therapies.
