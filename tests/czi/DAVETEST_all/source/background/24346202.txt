Science, aesthetics and race: images and texts inO Brasil Médico, 1928-1945
This study addresses the formation of discourse about race and eugenics in texts and images published in O Brasil Médico, between 1928 and 1945. The documental analysis inspired on Foucault's theoretical and methodological perspectives, especially the concept of biopolitics, encountered references to the problems of eugenics amongst the Brazilian population, as well as a set of illustrations, mostly photographs of black people's bodies. A contradiction was identified, where a universalistic discourse about race was expressed at the same time that discourses about eugenics and biotypes revealed concerns about the degeneration of the formation of the Brazilian race. These discourses describe a Brazilian race with an idealized standard of physical and moral normality to serve as a model for the development and modernization of the nation.
