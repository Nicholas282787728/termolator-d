Comparison of the effects of carboxytherapy and radiofrequency on skin rejuvenation
Carboxytherapy (CA) refers to the cutaneous and subcutaneous administration of CO(2) for therapeutic purposes. Radiofrequency (RF) is a method that uses electric current for heating layers of the skin. Both techniques are indicated for the treatment of skin laxity. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of CA and RF on human skin. After eight patients underwent abdominoplasty, each of them received a single treatment of CA and a single treatment of RF on the right and left infra-umbilical regions, respectively. In the infra-umbilical region, CA was performed on the right and RF was performed on the left side. Untreated skin was used as a control. The sample collection period lasted 120 days. CA was administered at a velocity of 40 mL/min, and the total quantity of CO(2) infused was approximately 20 mL. RF was carried out at a temperature higher than 40Â°C on the epidermis for 5 min. CA and RF led to collagen remodeling; however, this result was more evident and lasted longer with RF. With CA an increase in elastic fibers was observed, whereas with RF no alteration was observed. Our results suggest that RF is more efficient than CA in stimulating collagen synthesis.
