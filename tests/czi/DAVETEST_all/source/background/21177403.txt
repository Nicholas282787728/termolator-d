Optimizing management of invasive mould diseases
We describe an integrated care pathway (ICP) for the optimal management of invasive mould disease (IMD). The ICP is for use by health professionals involved in the care of patients with haematological malignancies and haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients who are at increased risk of IMD. The ICP is not intended for use in other patient groups where the evidence base is more limited. The ICP involves the patient and their carers, as well as describing the roles and the complex interaction of healthcare professionals in different departments. Therefore, the management of IMD as described in the ICP must be appropriate for the overall organization, and will be dependent on the facilities [e.g. high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration] and services available. The ICP deals with risk stratification, diagnostic tests, prophylactic and treatment strategies and how to incorporate these into the ICP. Outpatient drug management after hospital discharge and cessation of therapy are outlined. Local implementation of this ICP will vary from centre to centre: the ICP is a generic template for guidance indicating the requirements for optimal IMD management and as such provides a standard against which local practice can be audited. For clinical governance, to minimize variation in practice and, ultimately, to improve patient outcomes, each centre should regularly monitor and document compliance with the local ICP, from provision of patient information, appropriate prescribing and diagnostic investigation to clinical outcomes.
