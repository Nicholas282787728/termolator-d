Assessment of the relationship between Helicobacter pylori infection, endoscopic appearance and histological changes of the gastric mucosa in children with gastritis (a single center experience)
Helicobacter pylori infection is an important cause of gastritis in childhood, its role in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease in adults and children being generally known. In some cases, there are therapeutic management issues, because they do not heal or they often relapse, although treatment regimens are applied as recommended. Our aim was to analyze the relationship between endoscopic appearance and histological changes of the gastric mucosa in children with gastritis associated with H. pylori infection, in which persistent infection after treatment was found. It was a prospective study on 1332 children assessed in our Service (Ist Pediatric Clinic, Tirgu Mures, Romania), between January 2008 and January 2013, for gastritis with various etiologies. There were 609 cases of gastritis-associated with H. pylori infection. The average age of patients was 13.21 years; the higher incidence was noted in 13-18-year-old group, female gender and rural areas provenience; a number of 544 patients diagnosed with gastritis with H. pylori were reassessed subsequently; after treatment, gastritis has healed and the infection was eradicated in 88.23% cases after a month, while in 64 patients infection persisted. After a second regimen, endoscopic-histological modifications persisted in 31 (5.69%) cases; 1.28% cases remained positive for longer. H. pylori infection was associated with high age group, as well as with endoscopic modifications; also, the presence of H. pylori was correlated with histopathologic diagnostic. We try to emphasize the importance of assessing bacterial resistance to antibiotics, studying of bacterial genome and genetic susceptibility of human subjects.
