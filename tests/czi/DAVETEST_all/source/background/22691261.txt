Atopy as a risk factor for thyroid autoimmunity in children
Recently, there has been considerable interest in the relationship between allergic and autoimmune diseases. We evaluated the prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in 566 children affected by atopic dermatitis (AD), urticaria, rhinitis, chronic cough, and asthma. Our results suggest that allergy and autoimmunity can be two potential outcomes of dysregulated immunity. It is tempting to speculate that NK Th2 cells can favour asthma onset and at the same time improve thyroid autoimmunity.
