Atypical subtrochanteric fractures after long-term bisphosphonate therapy
There have been many reports published in recent years on atypical subtrochanteric fractures after long-term bisphosphonates therapy. In a description of a few series of cases, fractures of typical clinical course and radiological image have been documented. These fractures are estimated as very rare (2.3 per 10,000 patient-years). It is suggested that a subsequent use of steroids or proton pump inhibitors with bisphosphonates may increase the risk of fracture occurrence.
