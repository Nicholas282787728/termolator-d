Blocking initial infiltration of pioneer CD8(+) T-cells into the CNS via inhibition of SHP-2 ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice
In contrast to T-cell priming in the periphery, therapeutic strategies targeting the initiation step of T-cell trafficking into the CNS have not been extensively investigated. In this study, we examined the effect of NSC-87877, a potent Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) inhibitor, on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and elucidated its unique mechanism of action. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein35-55 and monitored for clinical severity of disease and histopathological features in the CNS. Levels of cytokines in serum were measured by elisa. Effects of NSC-87877 on expressions of chemokines and cytokines in the CNS were determined by quantitative PCR. NSC-87877-treated mice developed conventional TH 1 and TH 17 responses, but were highly resistant to the induction of EAE. NSC-87877 decreased the accumulation of lymphocytes in the CNS and increased the functional expression of chemokine receptor CXCR7 on CD8(+) T-cells. Adoptive transfer of T-cells from 2D2-transgenic mice restored EAE susceptibility in NSC-87877-treated mice, indicating that NSC-87877 only targets the initial migration of pioneer T-cells. Furthermore, T-cell-conditioned SHP-2-deficient mice treated with NSC-87877 were no longer resistant to EAE, suggesting that inhibition of SHP-2 contributes to the amelioration of EAE by NSC-87877. NSC-87877 almost completely abolished the development of EAE by blocking the initial infiltration of pioneer CD8(+) T-cells into the uninflamed CNS. These results reveal a critical role for SHP-2 in regulating EAE pathogenesis and indicate that NSC-87877 is a potential candidate for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
