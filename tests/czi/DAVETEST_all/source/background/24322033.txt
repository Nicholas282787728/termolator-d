Correlation between histopathological aspects of periodontitis and biochemical changes of oxidative stress
The aim of this paper is to assess the histopathological changes and the condition of oxidative stress in the saliva of the patients with periodontal disease. We have carried out our research on two groups of patients with periodontitis (a group of 16 patients with stage I periodontitis and a group of 16 patients with stage II periodontitis), who we have compared, using samples of saliva and serum, to a group of 15 volunteers without any dental restorations. To dose MDA, we used thiobarbituric acid method and for determination of ceruloplasmin the Ravin's method. For histopathological examination, the periodontal fragments were immediately underwent for fixation in 10% neutral formalin solution and then, they were included in paraffin using the conventional histological technique. The group of patients with stage II periodontitis presented lower values of salivary MDA compared to the group of patients with stage I periodontitis. Patients with stage I periodontitis presented a significantly increased concentration of MDA in the serum compared to the control group, but considerably lower concentrations compared to patients with stage II periodontitis. The values of serum ceruloplasmin do not present statistically important changes in patients with stage I periodontitis compared to those suffering from stage II periodontitis and to those from the group control. MDA is not a product of blood filtration as the concentration of MDA in the bloodstream is bigger than in the saliva. Tissue changes and biochemical aspects are strongly connected. Removing dental plaque can prevent oral infections.
