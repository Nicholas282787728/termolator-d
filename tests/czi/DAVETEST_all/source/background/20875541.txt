Usefulness of failure mode and effects analysis to improve patient safety during the process of incorporating new nurses in an intensive care unit
To analyze proactively the process of incorporating new nurses in the intensive care unit (ICU) in order to detect risk areas and establish improvements that increase critical patient safety. Once the risk area was defined, the different phases of failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) were applied: work team selection; process design; process phases definition; failure modes, possible causes and effects analysis; risk priority for each failure, and development of ameliorating and corrective actions. The proposed actions consisted of an orientation and training program (theoretical and practical) for new nurses, a supervision plan, a progressive responsibility program and ICU participation in personnel recruitment. Twelve nurses began to work in the ICU during the first 18 months of the program's implementation. Of these, only one nurse had full experience in critical care and three had partial experience. Participation of the ICU in personnel recruitment was nil. All the nurses with no or partial experience followed the orientation program (nursing supervisor interview, test of previous knowledge, handing over of the employee handbook, etc.), the theoretical and practical training program (supervision and tutorship) and the progressive responsibility program. More than half (63.6%) of the new nurses had another nurse duplicating their jobs during the training period and 54.5% of the new nurses attended the critical care course for nurses. Nurses participating in the orientation and training program expressed a high level of satisfaction. These measures helped nurses to decrease their stress and anxiety, increase and consolidate their knowledge, and provide safer care to critical patients. FMEA is a useful tool for improving ICU processes, even those involving human resources. The improvements implemented to decrease clinical risk related to the incorporation of new nurses in the ICU, based on previous training, will increase the safety of critical patient care by decreasing human errors due to inexperience.
