Removing biofilm from a endoscopic: evaluation of disinfection methods currently used
Laboratory experimental study that compared the effectiveness of five methods of disinfection for the removal of biofilm in gastrointestinal endoscopes. New transparent tubes of polytetrafluoroethylene (TeflonÂ®) were used as specimens to simulate the channels of flexible endoscopes. After pre-cleaning the tubes were intentionally contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and subjected to disinfection methods. As a result, none removed 100% of these biofilms. What else physically removed biofilm was 2% glutaraldehyde in an automatic processor, probably justified by the double clean, since the equipment has this phase at the beginning of your cycle. The method less effective for removing plaque and other debris was the acidic electrolytic water. These results suggest that the cleaning is most striking in the removal of biofilms that disinfection of consecutive since glutaraldehyde disinfectant by machine is more efficient, it is a fastener organic waste.
