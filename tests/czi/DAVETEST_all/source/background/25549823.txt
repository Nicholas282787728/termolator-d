Management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy in patients with left ventricular assist devices
Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have increased the survival of patients with advanced heart failure fourfold. Despite these advances, significant bleeding and thrombotic complications occur. Hemorrhage requiring surgery has been reported in up to 30% of adults and 50% of children after LVAD placement. LVAD thrombosis and embolic stroke lead to significant long-term morbidity. Adults are treated with antithrombotic therapy to prevent thrombotic complications, but the amount and intensity of treatment differs between institutions. The goal international normalized ratio for warfarin therapy varies from 1.5 to 3.0. Some physicians manage adult LVAD patients without antiplatelet medication, whereas other adults are treated with aspirin as a single agent or combined with dipyridamole. In contrast, physicians typically manage children with LVADs using the Edmonton Anticoagulation and Platelet Inhibition Protocol, a detailed algorithm for anticoagulation and antiplatelet treatment modified based on thromboelastography results. LVAD implantation causes consumption of coagulation proteins, activation of fibrinolysis, and loss of high molecular weight von Willebrand protein multimers. How these changes in the coagulation system influence the risk of hemorrhage and initiation of thrombosis is unknown. Prospective, controlled studies are needed to determine the antithrombotic regimen that most effectively balances bleeding and thrombosis in LVAD patients.
