Striae after topical corticosteroid: Treatment with nonablative fractional laser 1540nm
Striae distensae are atrophic dermal scars associated with psychosocial stress. Several treatments have been used but there is no gold standard until now. Fractional photothermolysis has been described as a successful and safe method to treat scars. In this description, we report 4 patients (Fitzpatrick phototype IV) who developed striae distensae after long-term use of topical corticosteroids and were successfully treated with fractional nonablative 1540 nm Erbium: glass laser.
