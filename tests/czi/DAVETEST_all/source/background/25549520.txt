Effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on bone formation after the expansion of the inter-premaxillary suture in rats: a histologic and immunohistochemical study
Orthodontic maxillary expansion is a commonly-performed treatment approach to correct transverse maxillary deficiencies by separating the mid-palatal suture. To obtain a successful treatment result and prevent relapse, the expanded maxillary sutures require maintenance by means of qualified bone reorganisation. To assess the effects of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) on sutural bone formation after the expansion of the interpremaxillary suture in rats. Sixteen male Wistar rats, 6 to 8-week old, were used. The expansion appliance comprised a helical spring fabricated from 0.014 inch stainless steel wire (Dentaurum, Ispringen, Germany). The rats were divided into two equal groups and randomly assigned to the LIPUS treatment group or a sham-operation group. LIPUS was delivered via a 2.5 cm diameter ultrasound transducer (Exogen, Smith and Nephews, Inc., Memphis, TN, USA) for 20 minutes per day during 7 days of post-expansion retention. Following retention, the rats' maxillae were surgically removed and histologic and immunohistochemical specimens were prepared and examined. The number of osteoblasts and blood vessel dimensions in the ultrasound group increased but was not significant, compared with the control group. A statistically significant difference in osteocalcin, VEGF and TGF-β immunoreactivities (p < 0.01) was found in the area of the mineralising tissue. Only VEGF immunoreactivity was significant between two groups (p < 0.01) in the fibrous tissue area. The area of mineralising tissue in the LIPUS-applied group expressed activity markers for osteocalcin, VEGF and TGF-β compared with a surrounding area of fibrous tissue. Cellular activation in the LIPUS group was greater than that of controls. Therefore, LIPUS may be accepted as a useful approach to enhance sutural bone formation.
