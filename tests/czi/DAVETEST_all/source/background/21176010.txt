Drugs and toxins-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension: lessons learned and challenges ahead
Since the identification of the link between pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and exposure to certain drugs and toxins nearly fifty years ago, the expanding landscape of available pharmaceuticals and illicit drugs is further fueling this association. While some causative agents in drugs and toxins associated PAH (D&T-APAH) have been identified, little is known about the exact biology and clinical implications of the disease. In this review, we discuss the historical evidence that links PAH with exposure to anorexinogens, cocaine, and methamphetamines and concentrate on what is known about potential pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and current management. We conclude that future research should focus on studies looking at clinical outcome and susceptibility factors.
