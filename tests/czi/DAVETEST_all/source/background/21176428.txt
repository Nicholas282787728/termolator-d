Spasmophilia comorbidity in fibromyalgia syndrome
To evaluate the role of spasmophilia (SP) in fibromyalgia syndrome (FM). Three hundred and fourteen patients (280 F, 34 M) with a diagnosis of FM or FM and spasmophilia (FM+SP) were recruited. Clinical assessment of patients and controls included the Questionnaires FIQ, HAQ and the tender point (TP) count. Life-time or ongoing psychiatric aspects were evaluated by trained psychiatrists by means of the classic scales: Structured Clinical Interview (SCID) for DSM-IV. The following analysis were evaluated: cytokine (IL1, IL2, IL6, IL8, IL10), TNF-α, cortisol, GH, ACTH, IGF1, 5HT, intracellular Mg, plasma calcium p(Ca), PTH, (25(OH)D) and thyroid functionality. Some typical symptoms were investigated. Eighty-one patients resulted positive for spamophilia (FM+SP), while 233 resulted negative for spasmophilia (FM). The mean TP number resulted higher in the FM group (15.33±3.88) with respect to FM+SP (12.88±6.17, p=0.016), while FIQ and HAQ did not differ between the two studied groups. FM patients exhibited a higher frequency of psychiatric disorders with respect to FM+SP patients (72% FM vs. 49% FM+SP, p<0.01). In particular the frequency of depression was 65.5% FM vs. 35% FM+SP (p<0.01). The presence of spasmophilia seems to influence psychiatric comorbidity which was less prevalent in FM+SP patients. FM is indeed characterised by an abnormal sensory processing of pain that seems to result from a combination of interactions between neurotransmitters, stress, hormones and the nervous system; spasmophilia would seem to be more linked to a dysfunction at the neuromuscular level.
