Depression and sexuality
affective disorders are commonly considered as specific psychiatric disorders treated with antidepressants and psychotherapy without links with sexotherapy. a non exhaustive literature review was conducted in the field of sexual medicine and sex therapy as well as in the field of affective disorders. there is a strong link between depression and sexual dysfunctions; moreover sexual dysfunction is an important underestimated adverse effect of certain antidepressant drugs. there is an urgent need to make psychiatrists and psychologists aware of the importance of the sexual life of their patients. They should learn to investigate and treat the sexual dysfunctions while assessing and treating the depression symptoms. Moreover they must be aware about the sexual adverse effects of many commonly used antidepressants drugs, especially SSRIs. the multi factorial origin of both depression and sexual dysfunctions suggests that the right approach and treatment of the depressed patient includes not only the prescription of an antidepressant but also a global approach based on several axis that are concomitants namely: physiological, cognitive, emotional, behavioural and relational factors.
