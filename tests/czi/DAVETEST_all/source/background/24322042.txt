Particular aspects in endoscopic surgery for juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas. Case reports and review of literature
Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas (JNA) are rare, benign, highly vascular tumors which appear in proximity to the sphenopalatine foramen. The tumor arises most commonly in adolescent males suggesting that in could be hormonally responsive. Although it is histologically benign, it has a high destructive potential and a high grade of recurrence. It is a fibrous vascular tumor with vascular sources from branches of the external or internal carotid arteries. Modern treatment of JNA includes surgery and also radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. This paper presents two cases from the eight of our clinic's experience, with morphological features which made their treatment challenging.
