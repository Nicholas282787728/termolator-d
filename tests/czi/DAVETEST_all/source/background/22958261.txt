American trypanosomiasis infection in fattening pigs from the south-east of Mexico
American Trypanosomiasis (AT) is an infectious parasitic disease produced by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi). Infection is acquired by vectorial via but can also be transmitted congenitally, by ingestion of an infected host, by transfusion with contaminated blood or transplant of organs from an infected donor. Currently, AT is widely distributed from the South of the United States to South America. In Mexico, the presence of the parasite has been reported throughout the country where several reservoirs such as dogs, opossums, rats and cats have been identified. Yucatan is in the south-east of Mexico where AT is endemic and has been reported since 1940s. There is little information about the role of pigs as reservoirs of T. cruzi. The frequency of specific antibodies against T. cruzi was determined in fattening pigs from Yucatan, Mexico. After sampling in the 3 main areas of pig production in the state, IgG ELISA and Western blot were performed to identify seropositive cases. Association of farm size, farm area and production system with infected pigs was evaluated. From 273 sampled pigs, 5.4% (n = 15) positive cases were found. No association with evaluated factors and infected pigs was found. Pigs are also reservoirs of T. cruzi in the studied area. These findings are considered important to improve vectorial control in the area in order to avoid the parasite infection in animal populations destined for human consumption and avoid further transmission to humans.
