The effect of videophone system for diabetic homecare patients on glycemic control
It is imperative to develop a novel care approach and low-cost health care system for diabetic patients.Therefore, we conducted an intervention study to clarify how effectively a videophone system could be used in the life style guidance focusing on diet for the diabetic patients cared at home.For the period of 3 months, diabetic patients were communicated with a medical professional staff bi-directionally through a videophone-based communication system for 30 minutes once a week.During the 30-minute intervention, the medical staff checked the list with the change in weight, drug adherence and an exercise habit.We encouraged a diabetic patient to eat properly based on the diet record.The 3-month intervention program resulted in a significant decrease in BW(p<0.001 ), BMI(p<0.001 ), and the average HbA1c level(p<0.005 ).In conclusion, we showed a 3-month intensive communication result using a multimodal videophone system, which revealed a significant decrease in the body weight, BMI and the average HbA1c level.This once a week ICT communication might be useful as an auxiliary therapy to help change a bad daily habit to a good daily habit for a diabetic homecare patient.
