Changes in blood gas transport of altitude native soccer players near sea-level and sea-level native soccer players at altitude (ISA3600)
The optimal strategy for soccer teams playing at altitude is not known, that is, 'fly-in, fly-out' versus short-term acclimatisation. Here, we document changes in blood gas and vascular volumes of sea-level (Australian, n=20) and altitude (Bolivian, n=19) native soccer players at 3600 m. Haemoglobin-oxygen saturation (Hb-sO₂), arterial oxygen content (CaO₂), haemoglobin mass (Hbmass), blood volume (BV) and blood gas concentrations were measured before descent (Bolivians only), together with aerobic fitness (via Yo-YoIR1), near sea-level, after ascent and during 13 days at 3600 m. At baseline, haemoglobin concentration [Hb] and Hbmass were higher in Bolivians (mean ± SD; 18.2 ± 1.0 g/dL, 12.8 ± 0.8 g/kg) than Australians (15.0 ± 0.9 g/dL, 11.6 ± 0.7 g/kg; both p ≤ 0.001). Near sea-level, [Hb] of Bolivians decreased to 16.6 ± 0.9 g/dL, but normalised upon return to 3600 m; Hbmass was constant regardless of altitude. In Australians, [Hb] increased after 12 days at 3600 m to 17.3 ± 1.0 g/dL; Hbmass increased by 3.0 ± 2.7% (p ≤ 0.01). BV decreased in both teams at altitude by ∼400 mL. Arterial partial pressure for oxygen (PaO₂), Hb-sO₂ and CaO₂ of both teams decreased within 2 h of arrival at 3600 m (p ≤ 0.001) but increased over the following days, with CaO₂ overcompensated in Australians (+1.7 ± 1.2 mL/100 mL; p ≤ 0.001). Yo-YoIR1 was lower on the 3rd versus 10th day at altitude and was significantly related to CaO₂. The marked drop in PaO₂ and CaO₂ observed after ascent does not support the 'fly-in, fly-out' approach for soccer teams to play immediately after arrival at altitude. Although short-term acclimatisation was sufficient for Australians to stabilise their CaO₂ (mostly due to loss of plasma volume), 12 days appears insufficient to reach chronic levels of adaption.
