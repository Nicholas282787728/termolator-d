Themes and characteristics of medical students' self-identified clerkship learning goals: a quasi-statistical qualitative study
Investigators sought to clarify the characteristics of students' self-identified learning goals. Goals collected from two schools were categorized into content themes and as specific or general qualitatively. Associations between learner characteristics and the distributions of goals were analyzed quantitatively. Investigators obtained 879 goals from 290 students. Clinical skills were most frequently identified (89%), followed by medical knowledge (44%), career choice (17%), and attitudinal goals (15%). Within clinical skills, 12 subcategories emerged. Improving oral presentations and critical-thinking ability were more common during the first six months (15% versus 7%, P = .05; 16% versus 8%, P = .04), whereas management skills dominated during the second half of the academic year (18% versus 31%, P = .01). Half of students (n = 146; 50%) listed only general goals, and the specificity did not increase over time. Students' main goal was acquiring clinical skills. Their focus within clinical skills shifted to more advanced skills but remained nonspecific.
