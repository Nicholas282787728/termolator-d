Arthroscopic double strand wire fixation anteriorly and posteriorly to anterior cruciate ligament for tibial intercondylar eminence fracture
To explore the clinical outcomes of arthroscopic double strand wire fixation anteriorly and posteriorly to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) for tibial intercondylar eminence fracture. From January 2009 to February 2012, 12 patients with tibial intercondylar eminence fracture were selected. There were 4 males and 8 females with an average age of 19.5 Â± 10 (10-50) years. Time from injury to operation was 4 days to 2 years. All cases belonged to Meyers-Mekeever type II and type III. Arthroscopic double strand wire compressive fixation was performed anteriorly and posteriorly to ACL. Other measures included postoperative rehabilitation and supports with brace in knee extension when weight-bearing for 4-6 weeks. The average follow-up period was 15.6 (6-30) months. Final clinical results showed good range of motion and good knee stability. On postoperative radiology, there were good reduction of intercondylar eminence fracture and excellent healing. There was no occurrence of wire rupture. Postoperative IKDC and Lysholm scores were excellent (n = 10) and good (n = 2). There was no such complication as fragmentation of intercondylar eminence fracture bone, neurovascular injury or infection. Arthroscopic double strand compressive fixation for tibial intercondylar eminence fracture may be easily performed without injury to ACL substance. The reduction is both stable and reliable. And the clinical outcome is excellent.
