A novel Mn(2+)-doped core/shell quantum dot-based intracellular probe for fluoride anions sensing in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells
In this paper, 3-aminobenzeneboronic acid functionalized Mn(2+)-doped ZnTe/ZnSe quantum dots (APBA-dQDs) were prepared. The APBA functional groups had strong binding ability with F(-), resulting in the quenchment of dQDs photoluminescence (PL). Under the optimal condition, the fluorescence intensity of APBA-dQDs was related linearly to the concentration of F(-) in the range of 0.25-1.5µmol/L with a detection limit of 0.1µmol/L. The selectivity of fluorescence quenching of APBA-dQDs for F(-) was enhanced. Moreover, the proposed methodology for the sensing of F(-) at EM 560nm in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells was demonstrated and got a satisfactory results. The results indicate that the APBA-dQDs are promising candidates for intracellular in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first report of F(-) sensing by using the quenched fluorescence of APBA-dQDs in non-cancerous cells.
