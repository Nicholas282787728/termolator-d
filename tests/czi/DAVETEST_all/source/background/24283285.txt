Important considerations in the development of toothpaste formulations for children
A number of factors should be taken into account when designing toothpaste formulations for use by children at the different stages of their development. While adult toothpaste formulations may provide caries prevention benefits for children at risk of caries, these formulations may also contain higher levels of abrasive in order to address the staining needs of the adult population owing to smoking and the consumption of dietary chromogens such as coffee and tea, which are not normally found in the diet of children. While toothpastes formulated for adults are also likely to contain higher concentrations of surfactant and flavour, many children prefer toothpastes with mild flavours and modest foaming characteristics. An ideal children's toothpaste formulation should therefore aim to maximise fluoride availability, with appropriate abrasivity, while still delivering effective cleaning, as well as levels and types of flavour and surfactant to provide an acceptable brushing experience. Selection of toothpaste flavour types for children of different ages should ideally be based directly upon preference data from children. Flavours perceived as pleasant during brushing studies have been linked to increased brushing time, which, in turn, can increase the delivery and efficacy of fluoride from toothpastes. Therefore, manufacturers select tested, child-friendly flavours to maximise compliance, providing a more pleasurable brushing experience and oral health benefits.
