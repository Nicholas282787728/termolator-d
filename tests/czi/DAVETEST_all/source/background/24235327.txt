Interest of NT-proBNP in chronic heart failure follow-up
Reducing readmissions after hospitalisation for acute heart failure is the new challenge of these diseases, approaching 30% within 60 to 90 days of discharge. Congestion related to high ventricular filling pressures, reflected by the high levels of natriuretic peptides, is the main reason for heart failure readmission. Natriuretic peptide levels are a patent prognostic marker of cardiovascular event in chronic heart failure. Treshold values of BNP and NT-proBNP being respectively 125 and 1000 pg/mL. Optimizing treatment of heart failure by monitoring natriuretic peptides, including management of diuretic doses, remains matter of controversies.
