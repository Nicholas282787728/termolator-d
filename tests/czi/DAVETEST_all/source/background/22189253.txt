Breastfeeding and allergy: the evidence
Whether breastfeeding protects against the development of allergic disease has been a frequent subject of study and debate for 75 years. This paper summarizes the published evidence concerning the risks of atopic dermatitis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, positive allergen skin tests, and food allergy associated with infant feeding. The summary is based largely on systematic reviews and meta-analyses carried out by other authors. In addition, I also incorporate the evidence from our long-term follow-up of Belarusian children participating in a cluster-randomized trial of a breastfeeding promotion intervention.
