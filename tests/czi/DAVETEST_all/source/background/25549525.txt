Orthodontic treatment in cherubism: an overview and a case report
Cherubism is a rare hereditary disease that frequently manifests as a painless enlargement of the mandible and/or maxilla. The disease usually progresses rapidly during the first and second decades of life but it is self-limiting and often regresses. Although few orthodontic case reports describing cherubic patients exist, the timing and extent of surgical intervention is controversial. This present paper aims to review the treatment literature and provide a case report of a patient who underwent orthodontic/surgical management. The patient presented with severe cherubism in her late teenage years; her main complaint was poor facial and dental appearance. Multiple teeth were missing and those present demonstrated significant preoperative root resorption. Treatment consisted of orthodontic alignment of the upper anterior teeth and a recontouring osteotomy. Confirmed by the patient, the combination approach led to a significant improvement in facial aesthetics and better self-esteem. Tooth movement through the osseous lesions was uneventful and no further root resoption was observed. Orthodontic treatment may be undertaken in those affected by Cherubism even with pre-existing idiopathic root resorption, but patients need to be appropriately informed and consented.
