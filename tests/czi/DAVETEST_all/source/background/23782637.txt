Evidence-based interventions to prevent tobacco use among youth: a literature review
This paper reviews the current knowledge of empirically validated interventions aimed at preventing tobacco use among children and adolescents. Given the increasing number of daily smokers among young people aged 17, there needs to be an emphasis on interventions aimed at promoting healthy behaviors. The study used a standard protocol to identify and review the literature and to classify the selected interventions. 22 interventions were found to have a positive impact on youth smoking. More than half of the interventions are aimed at the general population, while the other programs target vulnerable populations or young smokers. The study found that most of the interventions are aimed at adolescents, though some are aimed at children under 12 years of age. Around half of the interventions use several strategies, including actions in schools, parent involvement and/or community participation. Almost all individual-based programs are designed to promote the development of psychosocial skills. Effective mass media campaigns and national strategies to restrict access to tobacco are also presented. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of programs in other countries and to promote reflection on professional practice in France.
