Depression: a preventive care between school and general population
much importance is given to the prevention of psychiatric disorders with greater social impact. Our interest has been focused for years on the school population in order to inform teachers and parents, and students themselves, of the existence of problems in particular depressive and psychotic illness and to provide them with tools to listen and to accieve effective referal to specialists. In addition it was asked whether it was possible, to do this with simple tools and quick detection of subclinical symptoms of disease predictors. courses have been carried out to train the teachers and parents of about 1000 pupils of age between 15 e 18 years. The pupils have attended a series of formative meetings and were administered a brief questionnaire. experience has shown that it is important to educate the adults who work with this age group. Furthermore the evidence of diagnostic entities and at risk subjects encourages us in this form of research.
