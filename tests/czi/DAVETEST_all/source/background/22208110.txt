Women and men in love: who really feels it and says it first?
A widely held belief exists that women are more romantic and tend to fall in love faster than men. Responses from 172 college students indicated that although both men and women believe that women will fall in love and say I love you first in a relationship, men reported falling in love earlier and expressing it earlier than women reported. Analyses also showed no sex differences in attitudinal responses to items about love and romance. These results indicate that women may not be the greater fools for love that society assumes and are consistent with the notion that a pragmatic and cautious view of love has adaptive significance for women.
