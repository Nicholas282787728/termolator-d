American Samoan women's health: experiences and attitudes toward breast and cervical cancer screening
Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Samoan women and, compared to women of other ethnicities in the United States, Samoan women present at earlier ages with advanced stages of both breast and cervical cancers. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of issues that may prevent women in American Samoa from using available cancer screening resources. Following approval from the Office of Samoan Affairs, we conducted four focus group sessions, in which a total of 55 women from urban and rural sites participated. Women were asked about their perceptions regarding barriers, knowledge, and past utilization of available cancer screening services. Among the participants, professional women were more aware and had higher utilization rates of age-specific screening services. Barriers to health care services included lack of awareness and fears regarding poor confidentiality. Our findings, which have been reviewed by participants, highlight the further need for outreach and education about female cancers. Screening rates could be increased and all services may benefit from increased collaboration between the American Samoa Department of Public Health and Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) Tropical Medical Center. Our findings underline a need for additional staff training in professionalism, particularly in the areas of confidentiality and respect for patients.
