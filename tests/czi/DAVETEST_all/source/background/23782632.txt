Evidence-based and promising interventions to prevent sexually transmitted diseases: a literature review
There has been a significant increase in the prevalence of sexually transmitted diseases in France over the past decade. TheÂ prevention and control of STDs are a major focus of the 2010-2014 national strategic plan on HIV and STDs. This paper reviews the current knowledge of evidence-based programs aimed at preventing sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). The study used a standard protocol to identify and review the literature and to classify the selected interventions. Twenty-seven interventions were found to have an impact on STD prevention. The study also found that most of the interventions were aimed at adolescents and were implemented in schools. This study aims to improve current interventions in this area and to promote the development and implementation of new programs.
