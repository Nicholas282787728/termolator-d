Lady Prelox® improves sexual function in post-menopausal women
The aim of this pilot, single-blinded study was to evaluate the efficacy of a proprietary, dietary supplement Lady Prelox® for supporting and improving sexual function in generally healthy, post-menopausal women. The Lady Prelox® and placebo control groups were comparable at inclusion with regard to the total Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) score, as well as for the six individual FSFI domains, with 40 women (50.1 ± 3.1 years) and 43 women (51.2 ± 2.3 years), respectively. At baseline the women in the verum group presented with a mean total FSFI score of 44.6 ± 24.1 which increased significantly already after four weeks treatment with Lady Prelox® to 70.9 ± 18.5 and further increased to 71.7 ± 23.9 after completion of the eight-week trial period. In the control group the mean total FSFI was 44.1 ± 22.8 at inclusion and non-significantly increased to 45 ± 21.4 after four weeks and 47.4 ± 21.8 after eight weeks, respectively. The treatment with Lady Prelox® was comparatively significantly more effective than placebo after both four and eight weeks of treatment (P<0.05). The individual six FSFI domains related to desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction and pain did all respond favourably to treatment with Lady Prelox®; however, with only marginable higher scores in the placebo group. Four women in each group dropped out because of inabilities to attend scheduled check-ups. No adverse effects were reported. This study opens an interesting perspective for women experiencing moderate sexual function impairment and suggests a promising new treatment option. Further studies with larger numbers of women, including also premenopausal and perimenopausal women are warranted.
