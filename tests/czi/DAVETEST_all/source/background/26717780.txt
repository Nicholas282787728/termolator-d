RISK FACTORS FOR INTRAVESICAL RECURRENCE AFTER SURGICAL MANAGEMENT OF UROTHERIAL CARCINOMA OF THE UPPER URINARY TRACT
To identify risk factors for developing recurrent bladder cancer in patients who underwent surgical resection for urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract. We retrospectively analyzed 322 patients who underwent surgical resection for urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract at the Jikei University Hospital and our affiliated hospitals between January 2005 and July 2011. Univariate and multivariate analyses by using the Cox proportional hazards model were performed to determine the risk factors for intravesical recurrence after nephroureterectomy in these 322 patients. Of the 322 patients, 111 patients (34.5%) developed recurrent bladder cancer after a median interval of 8.0 months. On multivariate analysis, the presence of a superficial tumor and the presence of a ureteral tumor were independent predictors for intravesical recurrence. The risk factors for developing recurrent bladder cancer were the presence of a superficial tumor and the presence of a ureteral tumor. Further investigation is required to evaluate the efficacy of perioperative intravesical therapy for the prevention of intravesical recurrence.
