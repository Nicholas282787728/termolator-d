Toward better care coordination through improved communication with referring physicians
Effective care coordination requires good physician-to-physician communication. The authors evaluated a new tool called the Communication with Referring Physicians Practice Improvement Module (CRP-PIM), which assesses and encourages improved communication among physician consultants and referring physicians. Eight-hundred three consultants (internists and subspecialists) completed a practice system survey and were rated by 12,212 referring physicians on 13 communication processes using a six-point scale. Consultants received an interactive performance report and selected targets for improvement. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlations, t tests, and factor analysis. Mean overall rating was high, at 5.53 (SD 0.23, range 2.46-5.95); consultants still identified areas for improvement. The generalizability coefficient for overall ratings was 0.78. Factor analysis supported two categories of ratings associated with consultants' gender, subspecialty, residency performance ratings, and specific practice system features. The CRP-PIM provides a psychometrically viable measure and encourages consultants to improve communication with referring physicians.
