Partners' representations of diabetes as mediators between patients' representations and adherence to self-care behaviors, in type 2 diabetes
The purpose of this study was to analyze partners' representations of diabetes as mediators between patients' illness representations and adherence to all self-care behaviors, in recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2DM) patients. The sample included 340 patients and their respective partners. The instruments used were: Revised Summary of Diabetes Self-Care Activities (RSDSCA); Medication Adherence Report Scale (MARS); and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire  (Brief-IPQ). A mediational effect of partners' representation of diabetes consequences was found between the same patients' representations and  exercise, foot care, and self-monitoring of blood glucose. Partners' representations of personal and treatment control, were mediators between the same partners' representations and self-monitoring of blood glucose. No partners' representations mediated patients' representation and adherence to medication or diet . This study emphasized partners' representations on patient's adherence to exercise, foot care and monitoring of blood glucose, in recent diagnosed T2DM patients. Interventions to promote adherence in T2DM should promote convergence between patients and partners' diabetes representations. This study provides some evidence for the need to treat T2DM within the dyad to improve adherence, starting after the diagnosis.
