Functional electrical stimulation based on a working pattern influences function of lower extremity in subjects with early stroke and effects on diffusion tensor imaging: a randomized controlled trial
To explore the possible mechanisms for improving lower extremity motor function in patients with early stroke through combining magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) technology and functional electrical stimulation (FES) based on human walking patterns. From August 2012 to September 2013, a total of 48 eligible patients were stratified according to age, gender, disease course, Brunnstrom staging and types of stroke. And the Minimize software was used to divided them randomly into four-channel FES group (n = 18), dual-channel FES group (n = 15) and comfort stimulation group (n = 15). For all three groups, general medication and standard rehabilitation were provided. Based on normal walking pattern design of FES treatment, four-channel FES groups received the stimulations of quadriceps, hamstring, anterior tibialis and medial gastrocnemius. For the dual-channel FES group, the stimulations of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus and peroneus brevis muscles were applied. In comfort electrical stimulation group, the electrode positions were identical to the stimulation group, but there was no current output during stimulation. Before and after 3-week treatment, three groups received weekly rehabilitation evaluations of Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA), posture assessment of stroke scale (PASS), Brunel balance assessment (BBA), Berg balance scale (BBS) and modified Barthel index (MBI). Before and after treatment, DTI examination was performed for some patients. Among three groups, general patient profiles and pre-treatment evaluations showed no significant difference. For intra-group comparisons versus pre-treatment, at week 1, 2 and 3, the scores of PASS, BBA, BBS, FMA and MBI had statistically significant differences (P < 0.05); At week 3 post-treatment, when four-channel and double-channel FES groups were compared versus pre-treatment, the scores of ipsilateral FA had statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). At week 1 post-treatment, MBI had statistically significant difference among 3 groups (P = 0.037). As compared with placebo, four-channel group had statistically significant difference [(52 ± 12) vs (38 ± 18), P < 0.05]; At week 2 post-treatment, the scores of PASS and MBI were (29 ± 3, 73 ± 13) in four-channel FES group versus (24 ± 8, 60 ± 17) in dual-channel FES group. And the scores of PASS, BBA, BBS, FMA and MBI were (9 ± 3, 8.3 ± 2.4, 37 ± 7, 22 ± 5, 73 ± 13) in four-channel FES group versus (21 ± 7, 6.2 ± 3.1, 24 ± 16, 15 ± 8, 47 ± 20) in comfort electrical stimulation group. When dual-channel FES and comfort stimulation groups were compared, MBI had significant statistical difference [(60 ± 17) vs (47 ± 20), P < 0.05]. At week 3 post-treatment, four-channel and dual-channel FES groups were compared, there was also statistical significance in FMA [(25 ± 5) vs (20 ± 7), P = 0.055]. The scores of PASS, BBS, FMA and MBI were (31 ± 3, 43 ± 8, 25 ± 5, 81 ± 13) in four-channel FES group versus (25 ± 8, 29 ± 17, 17 ± 9, 54 ± 25) in comfort stimulation group respectively. When dual-channel FES and comfort stimulation groups were compared, the scores of MBI were (71 ± 15) and (54 ± 25) respectively. And the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). At week 3 post-treatment, the scores of FA significantly increased [four-channel FES group (0.321 ± 0.172) vs comfort stimulation group (0.217 ± 0.135) (P = 0.020)]. When dual-channel FES group (0.333 ± 0.164) and comfort stimulation group (0.217 ± 0.135) (P = 0.049) were compared, the differences were statistically significant. DTI showed that four-channel FES group increased significantly, but contralateral fiber bundle was not obvious. And the improvements of dual-channel FES and comfort stimulation groups were insignificant. Compared with traditional dual-channel FES, functional electrical stimulation based on human walking patterns is more efficacious. And it helps to restore brain structure and function and promote motor function recovery in patients with early stroke.
