Are successful resident clinicians good teachers? Multidimensional resident assessment
GME training programs must demonstrate residents are prepared as both teachers and clinicians. We examined the relationship between faculty evaluations of residents' clinical performance and student evaluations of residents' teaching performance. Concordance tables for mean ratings and qualitative analysis of comments among 95 residents receiving evaluations by 267 faculty and 106 students. A total of 88% of residents received concordant ratings from faculty and students. When discordant, faculty gave higher ratings (P = .003). Ninety and ninety-one percent of faculty and student comments exhibited a positive tone. Faculty and students tended to agree on the successful and unsuccessful residents, supporting the validity of rating scale evaluations. Future research might focus on how to tailor resident remediation when discordant ratings or comments occur.
