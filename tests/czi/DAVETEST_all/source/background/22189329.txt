Palliative care workshop primarily aimed for physicians and nurses in order to improve the care of the end-of- life homecare patient
Since 2008, we held a palliative care workshop primarily aimed for physicians, who engaged in clinical practice for cancer treatment. In order to improve the end-of-life stage patient care at home, we made all sorts of efforts not only for physicians, but we also made a workshop available for healthcare professionals to participate. There were more than 60 people participated the workshop: our 20% of physicians and 24% of nurses, 13% of nearby hospital and clinic physicians, 12% of pharmacists and 17% of nurses. According to our questionnaire survey, more than 90% of the participants were satisfied with the workshop. Only 8% of the participants expressed that the workshop was rather difficult. From our analysis of the results, it was clear that we attained a high level of participants' satisfaction.
