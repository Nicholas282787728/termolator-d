The sepsis as cause of acute kidney injury: an experimental model
Sepsis associated with multiple organ failure such as acute kidney injury (AKI) shows a high mortality rate in critically ill patients. This study investigated the sepsis induced AKI in experimental models. Adult, males, Wistar rats divided into the following groups: Control-surgical control and Sepsis-sepsis induction for the cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Physiological parameters (rectal temperature, mean arterial pressure-MAP, serum glucose and urinary flow); renal function (creatinine clearance); oxidative stress (urinary peroxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances-TBARS) and kidney histological analysis were evaluated. That study concludes that sepsis induces AKI by endothelial injury with hemodynamic dysfunction, release of inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by tubular cells, in an association of renal vasoconstriction due to hemodynamic and inflammatory disturbances.
