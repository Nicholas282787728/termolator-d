Investigations on the antifatigue and antihypoxic effects of Paecilomyces hepiali extract
Paecilomyces hepiali, one of the most valuable and effective Chinese medicinal herbs, possesses potential antioxidant, immunomodulatory, antitumor and anti‑inflammatory properties. The present study aimed to investigate the antifatigue and antihypoxic effects of Paecilomyces hepiali extract (PHC) in a mouse model. Using a rotating rod, forced swimming and running assessment, the antifatigue activity of PHC was determined. PHC administration for 7 days had no effect on mouse horizontal or vertical movement, indicating no neurotoxicity at the selected doses was observed. Using a normobaric hypoxia, sodium nitrite toxicosis and acute cerebral ischemia assessments, PHC was confirmed to possess antihypoxic effects. PHC treatment for 7 days significantly enhanced the serum and liver levels of adenosine triphosphate, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, prior to and following 60 min of swimming. The levels of antioxidant‑associated proteins in the livers of the mice were analyzed using western blotting. PHC effectively increased the expression levels of phosphorylated (p)‑5'‑monophosphate (AMP)‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), p‑protein kinase B (AKT) and p‑mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The results of the present study demonstrated that PHC efficiently enhanced endurance from fatigue and had antihypoxic effects through elevation of the antioxidant capacity in the serum and liver, at least in part through the AMPK and AKT/mTOR pathways. These results indicate the potential of this natural product as an antioxidant in the treatment of fatigue, hypoxia and their associated diseases.
