Treatment of early-stage erythematotelangiectatic rosacea with a Q-switched 595-nm Nd:YAG laser
Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea presents as persistent erythema and telangiectasia with frequent flushing and blushing on the facial and extrafacial skin. Additionally, papulopustular rosacea shows acneiform papules, pustules, and nodules with persistent plaque-form edema. Despite garnering only grade-C or -D level recommendations, a 585-nm or 595-nm flashlamp-pumped pulsed-dye laser can be considered as an effective therapeutic modality for the treatment of rosacea in patients who are refractory to topical and/or systemic treatments. In this report, treatment with a Q-switched 595-nm neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser with low non-purpuragenic fluence proved to be safe and effective in treating early-stage erythematotelangiectatic rosacea in two female Korean patients. Laser treatment for rosacea was delivered with the settings of pulse energy of 0.4-0.5 J/cm(2), pulse duration of 5-10 ns, 5-mm spot size, 5 Hz, and 500 shots. Additionally, we found that remarkable therapeutic effects were achieved for both rosacea and melasma by combining Q-switched quick pulse-to-pulse 1,064-nm Nd:YAG and Q-switched 595-nm Nd:YAG laser treatments, which required only the changing of handpieces equipped with solid dye. In conclusion, we suggest that treatment with a Q-switched 595-nm Nd:YAG laser with low fluence may provide an additional therapeutic option for treating early-stage erythematotelangiectatic rosacea.
