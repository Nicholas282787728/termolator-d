Formation of electrochemically reduced graphene oxide on melamine electrografted layers and its application toward the determination of methylxanthines
The current study describes the electrografting of 2,4-diamino-1,3,5-triazine (AT) groups at the surfaces of glassy carbon electrode (GCE) and indium tin oxide (ITO) through in situ diazotization of melamine. The presence of AT groups at the surface of the electrode was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV). Furthermore, graphene oxide (GO) was self-assembled on AT grafted GCE. The oxygen functional groups present on the surface of GO were electrochemically reduced to form an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) on AT grafted electrode surface. Raman spectra show the characteristic D and G bands at 1340 and 1605Â cm(-1), respectively, which confirms the successful attachment of GO on AT grafted surface, and the ratio of D and G bands was increased after the electrochemical reduction of GO. EIS shows that the electron transfer reaction of [Fe(CN)6](3-/4-) was higher at the ERGO modified electrode than at bare, AT grafted, and GO modified GCEs. The electrocatalytic activity of ERGO was investigated toward the oxidation of methylxanthines. It shows excellent electrocatalytic activity toward these methylxanthines by not only shifting their oxidation potentials toward less positive potentials but also enhancing their oxidation currents.
