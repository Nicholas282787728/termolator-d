Urothelial carcinoma in bladder diverticula: outcomes after radical cystectomy
To characterize the clinical and pathologic staging of patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC) in bladder diverticula (BD) after undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) and determine the impact of UCBD on recurrence and survival. We reviewed our institutional database of patients who underwent RC for UC (1971-2009). Outcomes were compared between patients with and without UCBD. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Multivariable Cox regression evaluated associations between UCBD and survival. Inclusion criteria were met in 1991 patients. UCBD was seen in 77 (4 %) patients and occurred exclusively in men (mean age 68 ± 8.5 years). The highest pathologic stage tumor was found in the BD in 44 (57 %) of these patients. Pathologic upstaging was more common with UCBD compared with UC not in BD (48 vs. 39 %, p = 0.031). On univariate analysis, no differences in RFS or OS were observed comparing patients with or without UCBD stratified by clinically organ-confined (≤T2) and extravesical (>T2) disease. On multivariable analysis, the presence of UCBD was not associated with differences in RFS (HR 0.92, 95 % CI 0.59-1.42, p = 0.69) or OS (HR 0.98, 95 % CI 0.74-1.31, p = 0.92). Upstaging was common in patients with UCBD, observed in almost half of the patients. There were no differences in RFS or OS after RC when comparing patients with or without UC in a diverticulum stratified by stage.
