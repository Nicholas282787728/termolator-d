Rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis - pathology of acute inflammation
Histomorphological analysis of inflammatory lesions in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) display similarities but also major differences. Ankylosing spondylitis is characterised by two key pathological findings: sacroiliac joint and spinal inflammation and new bone formation with the possible consequence of bone fusion, usually in the axial skeleton. In AS the primary site of inflammation is located at the enthesis or subchondral bone marrow with bone marrow oedema, lymphocytic infiltrates, increased osteoclast density and increased microvessel density are typical findings in acute inflammation. In RA joint inflammation has its origin in the synovial membrane of peripheral joints. Osteitis in the subchondral bone marrow reveals similar findings compared to AS and it is suggested to occur secondary to inflammation in the synovial membrane. Structural damage defines the outcome in both diseases. However, in AS it is defined by new bone formation and in RA by the destruction of cortical bone.
