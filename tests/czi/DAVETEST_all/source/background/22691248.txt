Airways allergic inflammation and L. reuterii treatment in asthmatic children
Recently, it has been hypothesized that the oral administration of specific live probiotic strains may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of allergic inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the oral L. reuteri DSM 17938 administration (1X108CFU), in airways allergic inflammation in mild persistent asthmatic children. In this DBPC randomized study we selected 50 children (6-14 years old), affected by mild persistent asthma (GINA step 2) and allergic to HDM. At the run-in period (T-2), the children were submitted to medical examination, prick tests for the main respiratory allergens, spirometry and children asthma control test (C-ACT). We selected only the children with well controlled asthma (C-ACT >19 and FEV1> 80%). After two weeks (T0) the children were allocated into two groups, the FeNO was measured and the breath condensate was collected. Group A children were treated with the placebo (5 drops per day) and Group B children with L. reuteri (108CFU =5 drops per day) for 60 days. After the treatment period (T1), all patients were evaluated by medical examination, C-ACT, spirometry, FeNO measurement and exaled breath condensate analysis. The FeNO values showed a significant reduction (p=0,045) in L. reuteri group but not in the placebo group at the end of the treatment (T1). Furthermore, the cytokines exam showed an increase in IL-10 levels (p less than 0.05) and a significant reduction in IL-2 levels (p less than 0.05) only in L. reuteri group at T1. No significant differences in FEV1 values and C-ACT score were found in both groups. In conclusion, these data showed that L. reuteri (108 CFU) was effective in reducing bronchial inflammation in asthmatic children. No significant effect was found on FEV1 values and C-ACT score, probably because we selected children with well controlled asthma.
