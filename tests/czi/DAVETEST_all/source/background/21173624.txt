Hooks and wires--tried and true plus how to: POSNA1-DayCourse, April 29, 2009
Fixation of the scoliotic spine can be achieved through the use of hooks and wires. These tried and true forms of fixation are discussed less commonly in the current era of focus on pedicle screw fixation. Sublaminar wires are still commonly used for neuromuscular scoliosis, in unusual curves, and at the apices of moderate curves. With careful attention to the technique, sublaminar wires can be safe and versatile. Hook fixation is generally expedient and safe. Both types of fixation are considerably less expensive than pedicle screws. Technical pearls and pitfalls are reviewed.
