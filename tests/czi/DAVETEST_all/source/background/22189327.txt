Palliative Care Interactive Network in KAWAGOE: PINK for regional alliances
The Cancer Control Act has come into effect in 2007. As an important idea of the act, a regional based hospital for cancer treatment and care should respect cancer patient's autonomy and improve his/her quality of life. We have organized PINK (Palliative Care Interactive Network in Kawagoe)in order to fulfill the idea in practical palliative care. Our activities are: Annual conference, Civic forum on Relay for Life in Kawagoe , Patients' association, and Case study examination using our mailing list. This network was built based on our activities to realize an important idea of the Cancer Control Act.
