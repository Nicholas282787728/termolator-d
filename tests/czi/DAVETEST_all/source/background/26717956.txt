Identification of miR‑130b as an oncogene in renal cell carcinoma
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of renal tumor, which has a poor prognosis. Improvements in understanding the underlying molecular biology of RCC has led to systemic treatments, which have markedly improved patient outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary and worthwhile to identify novel biomarkers for RCC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be important in a wide range of biological and pathological processes, including cell differentiation, migration, growth, proliferation, apoptosis and metabolism. Aberrant expression of miRNA‑130b has previously been reported in tumors, however, its role in RCC remains to be elucidated. In the present study, the upregulation of miR‑130b was observed in RCC tissues and cell lines using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis, which was consistent with previous microRNA profiling in RCC. Furthermore, the effects of miR‑130b on cell migration, proliferation and apoptosis were examined using a wound scratch assay, an MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. The results demonstrated that the downregulation of miR‑130b by a synthesized inhibitor inhibited cell migration, suppressed cell proliferation and induced RCC cell apoptosis. The present study was the first, to the best of our knowledge, to suggest that miR‑130b may be a promising biomarker for diagnosis and a therapeutic target for the treatment of RCC. Further investigations are required to examine the roles and target genes of miR‑130b in RCC.
