Home medical support at Jikei Medical University
A clinical clerkship of home care has been introduced to third-year medical students since 1998 at our university. Visiting nurses from the regional visiting nursing stations would give actual trainings at patient's home to a lot of medical students every year. For the improvement of medical education, it is not sufficient to give actual trainings to the students from visiting nurses. Then what we can do for visiting nurses about the role of the medical University was to offer and introduce the programs of cardiac and respiratory assessment as lifelong learning for the visiting nurses. After these programs were finished, two kinds of questionnaires were given to all participants to examine the necessity and scheduling of these program: 1 ) The first questionnaires after the programs was of cardiac and respiratory assessment, 2 ) The second questionnaires was for the participants with the experience of these programs, 3 ) Last questionnaires was for all visiting nurses about our 41 regional visiting nursing stations to promote the new programs(eight programs: home hospice care and opioids, PEG for the nutrition, ICLS, management of respirator at home, management of IVH port, ECG, foreign body of the airway, and the anatomy of organs)for lifelong learning. 1 ) A total of 7 2 visiting nurses participated in our programs for about one year recently, and 100% of these attendants returned questionnaires. After the programs, almost all of visiting nurses agreed that these programs were meaningful for them and it should be continued. 2 ) A total of 2 10 visiting nurses participated in our programs for the past 5 years. Fifty seven percent(57. 1%)of visiting nurses returned questionnaires. After the programs, a lot of visiting nurses agreed that these programs were meaningful for them and it should be continued. 3 ) Nearly 50 percent (47. 8% or 213/446)of visiting nurses from 41 visiting nursing stations returned questionnaires. A lot of visiting nurses expressed that they would like to participate in the subject of hospice care and opioids, PEG for the nutrition, ICLS and management of respirator at home as new programs. For the role of the medical University to promote a home care, it is necessary to support a community-based home care with educational issues at the university and to offer the new program mentioned previously as lifelong learning with practical and essential issues for medical staffs at patients' homes.
