Natural killer cell cytotoxity and course of illness in depressed mood
There is now some evidence that depressed mood is associated with activation of the immune system. First, we evaluated, within a cross-sectional design, NKCA (in vitro) in 49 subjects meeting inclusion criteria either for a major depressive episode, for dysthymia, or for double depression. We found that recent and long depressive episodes (dysthymia) are associated with a lower immunodepression. Second, we compared two subset of subjects: 14 patients meeting criteria of major depression to 14 healthy controls. The data show a significant improvement in major depression when compared to controls througout a treatment combining supportive psychotherapy and 8 mg Reboxetineâ„¢.
