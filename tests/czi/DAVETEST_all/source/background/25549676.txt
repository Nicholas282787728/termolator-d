Levels of Beclin 1 and LC3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica and its significance
To explore the expression and significance of Beclin 1 and LC3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) before and after treatment during acute and recurrent acute phases. All outpatients, inpatients and healthy controls were recruited from our hospital from October 2012 to April 2014. During acute phase, PBMCs from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO)(pre and post-treatment) were immediately isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. And the expressions of Beclin 1 and LC3 were detected by Western blot. And relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and relapsing NMO (RNMO) patients were followed up and the expressions of Beclin 1 and LC3 proteins compared during two acute phases. Compared with normal controls, the expression of Beclin 1 in PBMCs from acute phase of MS and NMO patients decreased while the expression of LC3 increased. During acute phase, the expression of Beclin 1 significantly increased after treatment in MS and NMO patients compared with pre-treatment, but the expression of LC3 significantly decreased. The expression of Beclin1 obviously decreased in RRMS and recurrent RNMO compared with the previous period, but the expression of LC3 significantly increased. The autophagy level increases in PBMC from MS and NMO patients during acute phase. However it decreases after treatment. However, the autophagy levels significantly increase in RRMS and RNMO. And enhanced autophagy may play its role in the pathogenesis of MS and NMO.
