Long term groups for patients with psychosis in partial remission - evaluation of ten years' work
Outpatients with psychosis who attended long term psychotherapeutic groups were evaluated regarding their quality of life and attitude towards medication with self-report questionnaires. The DAI-10, Quality of life Brief questionnaires and clinical observation were used for evaluation. Most of the patients' participation in group therapy was rated as satisfactory or very productive by their group therapist. More than half of our patients rated the group therapy's influence on their life as important; only three of them noticed no importance of the group therapy on their life. The sample may be too small to show a statistically significant correlation between participation in the group and time spent in group therapy and attitude towards medication.
