Management of fingolimod in clinical practice
The efficacy of the innovative oral drug fingolimod has been proven in the largest study program in multiple sclerosis (MS) demonstrating reduced relapse and reduced disability progression in relapsing-remitting MS patients. Based on the extensive safety data of all clinical trials and the natural distribution pattern of fingolimod interacting receptors in organism, careful clinical monitoring is recommend and reviewed in this paper. Safety and tolerability data from clinical studies as well as current post-marketing experience present with high tolerability and easy-to-perform management of fingolimod. Here we present the recommended management of fingolimod in clinical practice starting with preparatory steps, first-dose application and long-term treatment period with fingolimod. This management of fingolimod in clinical practice ensure a safe treatment algorithm using fingolimod. We recommend documentation of fingolimod patients in clinical registries to generate postmarketing data on efficacy and safety of fingoilimod.
