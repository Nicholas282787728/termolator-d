Effect of different laparoscopic procedures for hydrosalpinx on pregnancy outcome of embryo transfer
To explore the effects of different laparoscopic procedures before embryo transfer (ET) for hydrosalpinx on pregnancy outcomes. Group A (n = 269) underwent laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy before ET while group B (n = 178) had laparoscopic bilateral tubal salpingostomy for hydrosalpinx. And the pregnancy outcomes of ET were evaluated. The implantation, pregnancy, abortion, ectopic pregnancy and live birth rates were similar in 2 groups (P > 0.05). The interstitial pregnancy rate was 10.27% after bilateral salpingectomy. The clinical pregnancy rate increased while the interstitial pregnancy rate decreased when the intervals between salpingectomy and ET were prolonged. But there was no statistical significance (P > 0.05). Laparoscopic tubal salpingostomy is as effective as salpingectomy for hydrosalpinx before ET. The interstitial pregnancy rate increases after laparoscopic salpingectomy. The interval between salpingectomy and ET should be appropriately scheduled.
