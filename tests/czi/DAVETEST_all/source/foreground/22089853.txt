Research in a non-academic setting: it can be done
The need for quality research to promote evidence-based practice and optimize patient care is well recognized. This is particularly relevant in orthopedic trauma care, as trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Across the spectrum of academic, clinical, and health care administration physician roles, research remains fundamental to bridging theory, practice, and education. A gap exists, however, between research and practice, especially for those physicians practicing outside traditional academic centers. Orthopedic trauma surgeons are well situated to contribute to important research; however the majority of those in practice at non-academic centers do not have a significant research component structured into their physician role. In this article, the authors outline the importance of orthopedic trauma surgeons outside of academic centers being engaged in research and present some advice on how to effectively participate in these endeavors. In this setting, orthopedic trauma research involvement includes asking researchable questions, being a savvy manager of research collaborators, staff, and funding, and finding one's own level of research involvement.
