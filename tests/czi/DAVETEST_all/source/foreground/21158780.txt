Neocortical posttraumatic epileptogenesis
Development of new excitatory connectivity and decreases in Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition are mechanisms underlying posttraumatic epileptogenesis in animal models. Experimental strategies that interfere with these processes, applied between the trauma and seizure onset, are antiepileptogenic in the laboratory, and have promise for prophylaxis of epileptogenesis after cortical injury in humans.
