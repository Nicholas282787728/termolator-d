Antiblastic treatment of haematological malignancies during pregnancy: a crucial decision
Antiblastic treatment of hematological malignancies during pregnancy poses a number of issues related to the curability of the maternal disease, the need of a prompt treatment and the potential toxicity of chemotherapy for the fetus.

The standard approach in non-pregnant women is illustrated as reference.
