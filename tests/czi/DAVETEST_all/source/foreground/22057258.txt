Desmopressin parenteral in patients with VWD1, VWD 2A and thrombocytopathy
Desmopressin (DDAVP, Minirin® parenteral), which induces the release of von-Willebrand factor from endogenous stores, is indicated in von Willebrand disease type 1 (VWD 1). In the present study effectiveness of DDAVP was tested and side effects were recorded in patients with VWD 1, von Willebrand disease type 2 (VWD 2) or thrombocytopathy (TCP). Subjects were analysed prior to and after Minirin parenteral infusion (0.4 μg/kg body weight (b.w.) over 60 minutes) for partial thromboplastin time (PTT, seconds), ADP/epinephrine triggered platelet-function analyzer (PFA-100) occlusion time (seconds), factor VIII activity (FVIII, %), VWF as ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo, %) and VWF antigen (VWF:Ag, %). Side effects of DDAVP during operative interventions were recorded per questionnaires by the patients. The mean ± standard deviation dose (n = 165 patients) of Minirin parenteral administered was 0.37 ± 0.02 μg/kg b.w., most often upcoming dental operations (57%) necessitated testing. Coagulation parameters of patients with VWD 1 or TCP normalised in almost all patients, but only in approximately 50% of patients with VWD 2 respectively. Appraisal of effectiveness of Minirin parenteral as good was 96% in case of VWD 1 and 95 % in case of TCP. During minor surgeries (n = 23) in 91% of the patients no complications and in 2 patients (9%) postoperative haemorrhages without need for further interventions occurred, but 83% of the patients reported adverse reactions in the questionnaires, although Minirin parenteral was well tolerated by all patients during DDAVP efficacy tests. Desmopressin is well tolerated and affective in patients with VWD 1 and thrombocytopathy.
