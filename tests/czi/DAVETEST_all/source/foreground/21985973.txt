Calcium sensing receptor and renal mineral ion transport
Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is a component of the C family of the G protein-coupled receptors. It is ubiquitously expressed in human and mammal cells but is more expressed in parathyroid glands and kidney cells. It is located on the cell plasma membrane and senses the changes of extracellular calcium concentrations. Thus, it may modify cell functions according to serum calcium levels. CaSR has a key role in calcium homeostasis because it allows parathyroid glands and kidney to regulate PTH secretion and calcium reabsorption in order to keep serum calcium concentration within the normal range. CaSR appears as an important player in the regulation of renal calcium handling and body calcium metabolism. Thus, CaSR may protect human tissues against calcium excess. In kidneys, its protective effect includes the stimulation of diuresis and phosphate retention, along with the potential prevention of calcium precipitation and deposition in kidney tubules and interstitium.
