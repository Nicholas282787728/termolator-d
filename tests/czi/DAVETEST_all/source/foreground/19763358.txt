Calibrated automated thrombin generation in paediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease
In adults, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic complications. The pathogenesis of IBD is not really clear and a high thrombin activity might contribute to disease progression. We wanted to see whether children with IBD have a higher thrombin generation (TG). Plasma samples were collected of 20 patients with IBD and of 60 healthy controls (age range from 10 to 19). TG was measured by means of Calibrated automated thrombography (CAT). The disease activity was estimated, using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) for Crohn's disease and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (PUCAI) for Ulcerative Colitis. In addition, we investigated F1+F2, TAT, TFPI and fibrinogen. There was a significant increase of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), lag time and time to peak in patients with IBD, while peak showed no difference to healthy controls. ETP and F1+F2 in children with IBD also showed a significant correlation with PCDAI (PUCAI) and fibrinogen. IBD in children is associated with high TG, but this seems to be caused mainly by the inflammatory process and not by any individual disposition.
