Haemophilia patients with HIV- and HCV-infection. Long term survival
At present (2010), we investigate in a long term study on psychosocial aspects of haemophilia at the Munich Haemophilia Centre factors which could be held responsible for the large number of still living HIV+ patients while many patients died from AIDS or from diseases caused by HCV during the 1990ies. We retrospectively compare medical and psychosocial data of 15 HIV+ long term survivors (L-S), 15 HIV+ later on deceased patients and 15 HIV-, all of them deriving from the original investigation group from 1985 including 52 patients (30 HIV+, 22 HIV-). We prove the validity of our psychosocial factors by the SF 36 which currently serves as gold standard. The actual psychosocial factors and medical parameters of the 15 L-S are checked against the data of the 15 HIV- patients. In 1985 already, we retrospectively found significantly higher values regarding psychosocial factors within the group of the L-S as opposed to the later on deceased ones. Highly significant are the facts that more than 90 % of HIV+ L-S have had a good relationship to their fathers and are still employed today in contrast to the deceased HIV+ patients. At present, the differences regarding psychosocial factors between HIV+ L-S and HIV-negative patients are vanishing.
