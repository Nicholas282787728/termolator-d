Scientific controversies in Brazilian television journalism: the coverage of stem cell research onJornal Nacional
In 1998, stem cell research became a subject of heightened controversy. In Brazil, the polemic came to a head in 2008 when the Federal Supreme Court commenced a judicial review of the new Biosecurity Law because it permitted the use of human embryos in research. This study analyzes the coverage of human embryonic stem cell research on the national daily evening news show, Jornal Nacional . A positive tone is observed, marked by a focus on the potential benefits of the research and omission of its limitations and risks. The limited success rate thus far obtained from embryonic stem cell research and the risks of inducing the formation of tumors were omitted, intimating that the only barrier to new treatments and cures was the legislation.
