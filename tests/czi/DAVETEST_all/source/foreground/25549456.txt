Influence of vibration on changes in S100B protein content of peripheral blood in miners
The authors studied influence of vibration on serum neurotropic protein S100B level in miners. Vibration appeared to cause significant effect on increase of this protein level. With that, there is a moderate correlation between the protein level and intensity of the vibration effect.
