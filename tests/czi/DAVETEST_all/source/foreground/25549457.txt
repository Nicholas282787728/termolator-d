Methodic approaches to evaluation of visual performance in professional computer users
Occupation-related and physiologic studies in workers using personal computers revealed variable degrees of changed visual performance in accordance with work conditions class and integral parameter of work intensity. Findings are that the performance change is caused by lower accomodation volume and decrease in temporary characteristics of clear vision stability. Correlation was established between work conditions class and percentage of the performance decrease during the working shift in videodisplay users.
