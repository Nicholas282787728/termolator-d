Pre- and post-dormitum epilepsies: idiopathic generalized epilepsies
Epilepsy and sleep have a profound bidirectional influence. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) comprises a fascinating group of syndromes that constitute nearly one-third of all epilepsies. These syndromes are genetically determined and affect otherwise normal people of both sexes and all races. IGE manifests with typical absences, myoclonic jerks, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, alone or in varying combinations and severity. IGE syndromes are typically modulated by the sleep-wake cycle, and particularly by the sleep-wake transition process, both in terms of the occurrence of seizures and interictal epileptiform discharges (IED), with pronounced susceptibility to sleep deprivation. IGE analysis from the point of view of arousal modulation enhances the concept of a biological continuum existing among IGE syndromes. At the same time, this analysis broaches the problem of syndromic diagnosis and identification of the factors influencing the phenotypic expression of some epileptic phenomena over the course of life with potential bidirectional influences between epileptic manifestations and sleep-wake processes.
