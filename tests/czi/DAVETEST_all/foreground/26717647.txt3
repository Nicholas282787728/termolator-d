Recurrent posterior reversible encephalopathy due to vasospasm and cerebral hypoperfusionin in acute leukemia: a case report
We report the case of a 4-year-old girl who presented with recurrent posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). She was diagnosed with B-precursor acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and was administered remission-induction chemotherapy. On day 28 of the induction therapy, she experienced seizure and prolonged unconsciousness. Blood pressure was slightly elevated. MRI revealed cortical cytotoxic edema in the right temporal and occipital lobes. In the right occipital white matter the lesion with vasogenic edema also existed. Three days later, MRI showed vasogenic edema in subcortical white matter of the right temporal right occipital and bilateral occipital lobes. The lesions had receded with time. Since the seizure occurred, the chemotherapy had been discontinued. The episodes of seizure and prolonged consciousness recurred 22 days later. MRI revealed vasogenic edema in the right occipital lobe, and MR angiography demonstrated vessel irregularity and reduced branch visualization in the middle and posterior cerebral arteries. Arterial spin-labeling (ASL) showed hypoperfusion in both occipital lobes. It suggests that vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion could lead to recurrent PRES in this case. It is possible that ASL might be more sensitive than MRI in detecting the lesions of PRES. It should be noted that PRES might recur in leukemia.
