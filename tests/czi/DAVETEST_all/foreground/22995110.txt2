Treatment and prevention of aortic regurgitation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation
Significant aortic regurgitation (AR) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been shown to be associated with worse mid-term outcome. The two-year follow-up results of the PARTNER US trial showed that not only â‰¥3/4 AR grade, but also grade 2 had a significant impact on mortality. Thus, prevention and treatment of significant AR after TAVI is of great importance. Usually, AR after TAVI consists mostly of paravalvular leak and significant central AR is uncommon. Here we describe measures to decrease the risk of AR after TAVI which are currently available.
