Fetal fibronectin testing in Ontario: successful government-sector collaboration to achieve high-quality and sustainable system change
Ontario's province-wide implementation of fetal fibronectin (fFn) technology, a test to identify women unlikely to deliver within two weeks of presentation with symptoms of preterm labour, is a notable example of evidence-informed system improvement and productive government-sector partnership. Increasing demand for costly, high-risk maternal and newborn care in Ontario hospitals prompted a provincial review. Sector experts identified potentially avoidable maternal admissions and transfers to high-risk units for evaluation of suspected preterm labour as an opportunity for system improvement. Limited access to fFn testing was documented, and expert consensus posited that funding rapid clinical testing to identify women at low risk for preterm delivery would yield a significant return on investment. An expert panel recommended evidence-based clinical guidelines. The government swiftly secured funding and initiated a successful implementation strategy, capitalizing on regional perinatal networks. Amassing clinical and care utilization information, framing the data in a policy-relevant context and partnering sector expertise with ministry capability resulted in this technology being effectively implemented in a complex health system.
