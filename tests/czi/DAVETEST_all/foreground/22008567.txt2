Reflections on knowledge translation in Canadian NICUs using the EPIQ method
The Canadian Neonatal Network conducted a trial of Evidence-Based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ) between 2002 and 2005. Improved neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) outcomes established credibility for quality improvement. We surveyed team members and physician leaders to examine critical success factors and barriers to improvement during EPIQ. Respondents agreed that EPIQ had a high utility, was effectively implemented and was a major learning opportunity. The collaborative nature of the project was key to success. Respondents identified the need for additional training and resources in quality improvement. Better communication between clinicians and senior leaders is required to support quality improvement in NICUs.
