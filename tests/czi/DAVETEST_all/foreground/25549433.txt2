Informed consent in valvular diseases
Informed consent has two aspects. First, we must give patients sufficient, precise information on the nature of their disease, natural history, possible choices of treatment, and risks of the treatment to help them make their own decisions. The estimated risks should be based on a database, not on personal impressions or limited experience. In choosing the type of prosthetic valve in young or middle-aged patients, unbiased information based on guidelines should be presented. The second aspect of informed consent is its role as a contract for providing medical service. Estimated in-hospital mortality and major morbidities should be clarified in percentages on the consent form as confirmation of understanding.
