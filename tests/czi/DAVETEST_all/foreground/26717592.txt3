BIOCHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ESTROGENS IN NON-REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS
Biochemical processes initiated by estrogenic hormones in the organs which are not directly related to reproduction were described in the survey on the basis of literature and the authors' own studies. The importance of these compounds in the regulation of fundamental biological processes has been established in the last decades. The biochemical mechanisms of realization of estrogen effects may be considered as potential links of pathogenesis for a number of diseases and as targets of their therapy.
