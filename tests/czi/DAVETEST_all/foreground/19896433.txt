Preview. Meninges Play a RAdical Role in Embryonic Neural Stem Cell Regulation
During corticogenesis, neural stem cells switch from symmetric to asymmetric divisions to generate intermediate progenitor cells and neurons. Recently published in Cell, Siegenthaler et al. (2009) show that retinoic acid derived from the meninges is a key signal controlling this transition.
