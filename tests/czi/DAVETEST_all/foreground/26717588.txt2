Patient satisfaction questionnaires in surgery: inpatients' perceptions and experiences of surgical wards in general surgery
The NHS continually promotes patient-centred care. One way of assessing this is by looking at inpatient satisfaction rates as this is a central aspect of patient care. A patient's experience during their surgical admission can impact their perception of the care they receive, their treatment, recovery and follow-up. Currently NHS questionnaires are often posted out following patient discharge to assess patient satisfaction rates. However, it is important to assess inpatient satisfaction as this can change following discharge. Our survey highlighted areas for improvement when delivering care.
