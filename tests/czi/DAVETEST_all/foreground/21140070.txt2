Substance use disorders are prevalent in emergency departments in medical and psychiatric services, reaching rates of 28% of cases in medical emergency departments. However, professionals in the emergency department identify less than 50% of cases of alcohol-related problems. This article aims to provide evidence-based interventions for the specific treatment to patients who meet diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders and who present to emergency rooms during intoxication or abstinence. A literature review was performed on Medline database, using the descriptors acute intoxication, withdrawal, alcohol, cocaine, cannabis, opioid, inhalant, management, using English as the language. AND CONCLUSION: The care of persons with substance use disorders should include: comprehensive assessment (medical and psychiatric), treatment of diagnosed disorders (withdrawal, intoxication and clinical features that characterize an emergency), awareness of the patient to carry out treatment if necessary and referral.
