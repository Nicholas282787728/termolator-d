Comprehensive models of treatment in individuals with autism spectrum disorders
INTRODUCTION. The steady increase in the number of children with autism spectrum disorders, has led to a better social awareness but also to a higher demand for specific interventions. This has questioned what the most appropriate and effective procedures for detection, diagnosis and treatment are. AIM. To review different approaches and classifications of interventions with individuals with autism spectrum disorders based on scientific evidence. DEVELOPMENT. According to the latest revisions, there are three types of classifications to categorize evidence-based interventions: practice-based intervention, comprehensive models of treatment and drug treatments. There are difficulties in comparing results of different methods of intervention, however, some common elements to prove their effectiveness have been identified. CONCLUSIONS. All intervention models should include functional communication skills, meaningful learning, carried out in various contexts, addressing challenging behaviors through positive behavioral support, promoting activities with peers and emphasize the role of parents in the planning and implementation of the objectives.
