Attitudes of patients and mental health staff to antipsychotic long-acting injections: systematic review
The attitudes of staff and patients have been demonstrated to influence the acceptance of long-acting injections (LAIs) or depot antipsychotics. To examine the attitudes of patients and staff to LAIs. A systematic review was carried out. Studies included contained quantitative data for attitudes of patients or staff to LAIs. Twelve studies published subsequent to the systematic review reported in 2001 were identified. Five studies conveyed an overall positive attitude. The most positive attitudes among patients were seen in those already prescribed an LAI. Positive attitudes of staff correlated closely with the extent of their knowledge of LAIs. Long-acting injections continue to have an image problem, arguably perpetuated by manufacturers of oral second-generation antipsychotic drugs, and exacerbated by the predominant use of these medications as a ;last resort' often for the most stigmatized individuals. The introduction of better-tolerated LAIs and better education of both staff and patients may encourage individuals to re-examine their attitudes.
