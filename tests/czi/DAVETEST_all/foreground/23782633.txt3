Evidence-based and promising interventions to prevent unplanned pregnancies: a literature review
Despite the widespread use of contraception, the number of unplanned pregnancies in France remains high. This paper reviews the current knowledge of evidence-based programs aimed at preventing unplanned pregnancies. The study used a standard protocol to identify and review the literature and to classify the selected interventions. Sixteen interventions were found to have an effect on contraceptive use, emergency contraception use or the number of unplanned pregnancies. Interventions in this area are aimed at children, adolescents or adult women. The aim of this study is to improve interventions in this area and to promote the development and implementation of new programs.
