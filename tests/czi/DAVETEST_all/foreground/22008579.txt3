Canada and the world: a comparative approach to injury prevention
Canada is consistently ranked as one of the best places to live in the world. A crucial part of this view is based on Canada's approach to public health, which has achieved measurable results in the rate reduction of some leading causes of disease and death. It is therefore surprising to learn that in tackling the leading cause of death for Canadian children and youth, Canada ranks a disappointing 18th of 26 nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (UNICEF 2001). Few are aware that unintentional injury is the leading cause of death for Canadian children and youth between the ages of one and 14. In Canada, injury kills more children and youth than all disease (Canadian Institutes of Health Research 2008). Unintentional injuries are a leading public health issue that directly impacts the health, well-being and quality of life of those injured, as well as their families, communities and greater society. Nevertheless, injury is often neglected, and investment is rarely equal to the magnitude of the problem. The reality is that injury prevention has not kept pace with other public health interventions such as tobacco control or infectious disease prevention programs. Despite its devastating impact, injury remains an invisible epidemic.
