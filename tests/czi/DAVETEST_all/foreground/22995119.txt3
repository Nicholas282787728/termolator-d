JenaValve
The JenaValve is a next-generation TAVI device which consists of a well-proven porcine root valve mounted on a low-profile nitinol stent. Feeler guided positioning and clip fixation on the diseased leaflets allow for anatomically correct implantation of the device without rapid pacing. Safety and efficacy of transapical aortic valve implantation using the JenaValve were evaluated in a multicentre prospective study that showed good short and midterm results. The valve was CE-mark released in Europe in September 2011. A post-market registry ensures on-going and prospective data collection in real-world patients. The transfemoral JenaValve delivery system will be evaluated in a first-in-man study in the near future.
