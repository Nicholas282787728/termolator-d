Photodynamic effects induced by meso-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole and its cyclodextrin conjugates on cytoskeletal components of HeLa cells
The aim of this work was to synthesize new corrole β-cyclodextrin conjugates βCD1 (with one β-cyclodextrin moiety) and βCD2 (with two β-cyclodextrin moieties) from 5,10,15-tris(pentafluorophenyl)corrole (TPFC) and to test in vitro the efficacy of these compounds towards tumoral HeLa cells. No dark cytotoxicity was observed for TPFC and βCD1 at the concentration used for PDT cell treatment, even during long incubation periods (24 h). Fluorescence microscopy showed that TPFC and βCD1 accumulate in HeLa cells at lysosomes and in the Golgi apparatus, respectively. The cell survival after the PDT treatment with visible light was dependent on light exposure level and compound concentration. βCD1 was able to penetrate efficiently in the cytoplasm of the HeLa cells. In particular, we have analyzed the photodynamic effect of the corrole derivatives on the microtubules of HeLa cells and the morphological alterations on the mitotic spindle. TPFC and βCD1 caused photocytotoxicity in tumoral HeLa cells and induced a rapid metaphase blockage of cells that also showed clearly altered configurations of the mitotic spindle. The results showed that TPFC has the highest photosensitizing efficiency on tumoral cells.
