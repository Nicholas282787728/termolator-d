MicroRNA-663 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells via targeting TGF-β1
Cell migration and invasion are key processes involved during tumor metastasis. Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in the regulation of cancer metastasis. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the exact role of miR-663 in the metastasis of glioblastoma as well as the underlying mechanisms. By performing quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, we demonstrated that miR-663 was significantly downregulated in glioblastoma tissues (n=25), when compared to that in normal brain tissues (n=15). In addition, its expression levels were also reduced in human glioblastoma cell lines, A172 and U87. Furthermore, restoration of miR-663 expression led to a significant decrease in the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of human glioblastoma A172 and U87 cells. We further identified TGF-β1 as a direct target of miR-663, and found that the expression of TGF-β1 was negatively mediated by miR-663 at the post-transcriptional level in glioblastoma cells. Moreover, overexpression of TGF-β1 significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-663 upregulation on the proliferation, migration and invasion in A172 and U87 cells. In addition, our data suggest that MMP2 and E-cadherin, a key factor in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), are involved in the miR-633/TGF-β1-mediated metastasis of glioblastoma. In summary, miR-663 plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of proliferation, migration and invasion of glioblastoma cells, partly at least, via direct mediation of TGF-β1 as well as downstream MMP2 and E-cadherin. Therefore, we suggest that miR-663 is a potential candidate for the prevention of glioblastoma metastasis.
