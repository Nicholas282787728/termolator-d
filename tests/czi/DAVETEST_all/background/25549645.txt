Establishment and validation of normal human L1-L5 lumbar three-dimensional finite element model
To create and validate a L1-L5 lumbar three-dimensional finite element model. The L1-L5 lumbar spines of a male healthy volunteer were scanned with computed tomography (CT). And a L1-L5 lumbar three-dimensional finite element model was created with the aid of software packages of Mimics, Geomagic and Ansys. Then border conditions were set, unit type was determined, finite element mesh was divided and a model was established for loading and calculating. Average model stiffness under the conditions of flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial rotation was calculated and compared with the outcomes of former articles for validation. A normal human L1-L5 lumbar three-dimensional finite element model was established to include 459 340 elements and 661 938 nodes. After constraining the inferior endplate of L5 vertebral body, 500 kg × m × s⁻² compressive loading was imposed averagely on the superior endplate of L1 vertebral body. Then 10 kg × m² × s⁻² moment simulating flexion, extension, lateral bending and axial rotation were imposed on the superior endplate of L1 vertebral body. Eventually the average stiffness of all directions was calculated and it was similar to the outcomes of former articles. The L1-L5 lumbar three-dimensional finite element model is validated so that it may used with biomechanical simulation and analysis of normal or surgical models.
