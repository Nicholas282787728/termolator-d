Idiopathic scoliosis: cracking the genetic code and what does it mean?
Idiopathic scoliosis is one of the most common complex genetic disorders of the musculoskeletal system. The clinical parameters relating to onset, curve progression, and severity in relation to clinical prognosis and current treatment modalities have been defined, but do not address the cause of this disorder. In an effort to define causative genetic elements, multiple studies have delineated potential genetic loci that are statistically related to idiopathic scoliosis in a variety of populations. The question remains how future genetic testing and genomic profiling may be of aid in the therapeutic algorithms related to this disorder.
