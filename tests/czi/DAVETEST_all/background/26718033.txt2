Isolation and comparison of mesenchymal stem cell‑like cells derived from human gastric cancer tissues and corresponding ovarian metastases
Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)‑like cells have been isolated from various types of tumor. It has previously been reported that MSCs are involved in tumorigenesis and its prognosis. The aim of the present study was to isolate and compare MSC‑like cells from human gastric cancer (GC) and its metastatic deposits in ovarian tissue. MSC‑like cells were isolated from human gastric cancer (hGC‑MSCs) and the corresponding ovarian metastatic tissues (hGCOM‑MSCs) from 40 patients. The characteristics of hGC‑MSCs and hGCOM‑MSCs, including their morphology, surface antigens, specific gene expression and differentiation potential, were similar to those of MSCs derived from human bone marrow (hBM‑MSCs) but different from GC cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that MSC‑like cells could be isolated from GC tissue and its ovarian metastatic tissues. The existence of MSC‑like cells in GC tissues and its ovarian metastatic tissues suggests that they may be a potential target for cancer therapy, and provides an experimental foundation for investigating their role in the initiation and progression of ovarian metastasis of GC.
