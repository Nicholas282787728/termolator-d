Modulation of Interleukin-8 and staphylococcal flora by Avène hydrotherapy in patients suffering from chronic inflammatory dermatoses
A number of studies argue in favour of an important role of microbial colonization, in particular of Staphylococcus aureus, in triggering atopic dermatitis (AD) flare-up and psoriasis, in particular through the superantigenic properties of toxins generated by S. aureus. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of a 3-week Avène hydrotherapy on the skin surface of patients suffering from psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. Skin samples were taken from healthy subjects or atopic (n = 18) or psoriatic patients (n = 39) undergoing hydrotherapy at Avène at the beginning (D0) and the end of treatment (D18). The severity of the dermatosis was evaluated according to SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) or Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) scores at D0 and D18. Marker of inflammation interleukin 8 (IL-8), S. aureus colonization (protein A) and enterotoxins were assessed in skin samples using RT-PCR. At D0, significant differences were observed between healthy subjects and atopic or psoriatic patients in all the parameters evaluated (IL-8, protein A). At the end of the hydrotherapy, a significant decrease in SCORAD was associated with a significant reduction of IL-8, S. aureus colonization and enterotoxin D in patients with atopic dermatitis. Similarly, a significant decrease in PASI was associated with a significant reduction of IL-8, S. aureus colonization and enterotoxin N in patients with psoriasis. This study demonstrates the positive effects of Avène hydrotherapy on the skin of patients suffering from chronic dermatosis, with decreased inflammation and reduced colonization by S. aureus.
