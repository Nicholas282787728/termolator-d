Contrast enhanced ultrasound in renal diseases
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is one of the most interesting and promising clinical applications of imaging and ultrasound. Thanks to the absence of ionizing radiation, the lack of nephrotoxicity and low cost it has the potential to become a reference in imaging of the kidney. This review, besides providing a brief description of the proper methodology, presents possible applications of CEUS in nephrology and urology, including renal ischemia, the differential diagnosis of cystic and solid lesions, follow-up of ablative therapies, kidney trauma, kidney transplant, inflammatory diseases, ischemic nephropathy and vesicoureteral reflux.
