Subjective memory complain in healthy elderly: influence of depressive symptoms, perceived stress and self-esteem
The current study analyzed the relationship between perceived stress, depressive symptoms and self-esteem in elderly with and without subjective memory complain. Two-hundred four elderly were included (104 without and 100 with subjective memory complain) assesse using the Memory Assessment Complain Questionnaire (MAC-Q). The study protocol was composed by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the Self-Esteem Scale of Rosenberg (SES). The elderly with subjective memory complain showed higher PSS and GDS scores (p < 0.001) and lower SES scores (p = 0.045). Negative correlation was observed between MAC-Q and PSS (p < 0.001) and GDS (p = 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed predictor effect of perceived stress in the subjective memory complain. These findings suggest that the perceived stress and depressive symptoms are associated with subjective memory complain in elderly.
