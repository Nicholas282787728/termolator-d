Predicting the sun-protective decisions of young female Australian beachgoers
We tested the theory of planned behaviour with additional norms to predict the sun-protective decisions of young female beachgoers in Australia. Participants (N = 336) completed standard theory of planned behaviour measures and additional normative factors (group, image and personal norms). Attitude, subjective norm, and both personal and group norms predicted intention. Intention and group norm predicted follow-up behaviour. These findings provide further evidence that it is the more proximal sources of norms reflecting one's personal and referent group influences, rather than perceptions of broader societal norms about the attractiveness of tanned images, that are important in determining young women's sun-protective decisions.
