Midwifery and maternity care in Nepal: the vital link
Nepal is one of the poorest countries of the world and its people suffer from many health problems associated with poverty. Maternity care is underdeveloped, women do not always seek maternity care or the help of a skilled birth attendant, even if the service is available. One key underlying problem is that Nepal lacks proper midwifery, as defined by international standards. There have been some very positive developments towards recognition of the distinct skills required for midwifery. In this paper, we describe a maternal health promotion intervention funded by a London-based Buddhist organisation. The intervention is community-based and works with women's groups in rural areas.
