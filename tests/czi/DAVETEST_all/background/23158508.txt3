Auxological evaluation of newborns
Auxological evaluation of the newborn should be based on accurate anthropometry at birth and a reliable estimate of gestational age (GA). However, a comprehensive evaluation of the neonate should consider not only anthropometric traits at birth, but also fetal ultrasound biometry and Doppler velocimetry. Many charts have been proposed, but they are hardly comparable with each other, due to numerous methodological problems. The Italian Societies of Neonatology, of Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology and the Italian Society of Medical Statistics and Clinical Epidemiology promoted a multicenter survey with the aim to produce an Italian neonatal anthropometric reference (Italian Neonatal Study [INeS] charts) fulfilling the set of the criteria that a reliable neonatal chart should possess. In order to construct an international standard, an international project (INTERGROWTH-21st) has started a study aiming to create a prescriptive standard. Until an international standard is developed, the use of national updated reference charts is recommended.
