Spatial Variation of Ammonia-N, Nitrate-N and Nitrite-N in Groundwater of Dongshan Island
In Dongshan Island, groundwater is the main resource of the local residents' drinking water, domestic water, agriculture irrigation and freshwater aquaculture. This study aimed to investigate the spatial distribution characteristic and its variation pattern of ammonia-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N in groundwater, as well as its pollution source and influence factors. It is very important to understand the pollution level of ammonia-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N in groundwater of Dongshan Island, the control and prevention of ammonia-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N pollution, which is of great significance to the residents' health. In this study, the spatial variability characteristics of ammonia-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N concentration in groundwater of Dongshan Island was analysed by geo- statistic method, the values of the non-observation points were determined by Kriging method, and the pollution characteristics of ammonia-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N in groundwater of Dongshan Island was also analyzed. Our results showed that the ammonia-N and nitrite-N concentration in groundwater of Dongshan Island were at low levels, but their spatial variability were high, and their autocorrelation were poor; however, the nitrate-N concentration was general high, its spatial variability was moderate, and the autocorrelation was much good. The distribution characteristics of ammonia-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N in groundwater of Dongshan Island were similar that the high concentration areas were all located in the coastal land. The domestic pollutants and human and animal wastes from towns and villages were the main sources of nitrogen pollution, which would be the first step to control the nitrogen pollution of Dongshan Island. Land use pattern, soil type, groundwater depth, pH, dissolved oxygen, season, and the existence of Fe2+, were the impact factors that influence the distribution and transformation of ammonia-N, nitrate-N and nitrite-N in groundwater, which could be the considerable factors in the control of nitrogen pollution in groundwater of Dongshan Island.
