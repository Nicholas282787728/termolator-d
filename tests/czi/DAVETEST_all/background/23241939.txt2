Forskolin and rutin prevent intraocular pressure spikes after Nd:YAG laser iridotomy
the purpose of this research was to evaluate whether an oral treatment with an association of forskolin and rutin can blunt the intraocular pressure (IOP) spikes and avoid the damage that may occur after laser iridotomy. Ten patients underwent bilateral Neodymium:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser iridotomy (Visulas YAG III Laser, Zeiss), for the prevention of primary closed-angle glaucoma. IOP was measured in subjects before and after 7 days of pretreatment with placebo or forskolin and rutin by Goldman applanation tonometry. The IOP was measured before surgery and after surgery at 30-60-120 minutes, and 4-7 days. Analysis of variance indicated a significant increase of the postoperative values in patients receiving treatment with placebo (p < 0.001), but not in those who received treatment with the forskolin and rutin association. T test analysis confirmed that IOP still remained significantly elevated 7 days after laser intervention in placebo treated patients, whereas it stayed within normal values in forskolin/rutin treated patients. Forskolin and rutin can blunt the increase of IOP that occurs after Nd-YAG laser iridotomy. This can avoid serious risk to the optic nerve of the patients under laser treatment for iridotomy.
