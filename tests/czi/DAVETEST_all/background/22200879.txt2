The genetic screening of preimplantation embryos by comparative genomic hybridisation
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is an indirect DNA-based test which allows for the accurate analysis of aneuploidy involving any of the 24 types of chromosomes present (22 autosomes and the X and Y sex chromosomes). Traditionally, embryos have been screened using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)--a technique that was limited in the number of chromosomes able to be identified in any one sample. Early CGH reports on aneuploidy in preimplantation embryos showed that any of the 24 chromosomes could be involved and so FISH methods were going to be ineffective in screening out abnormal embryos. Our results from routine clinical application of array CGH in preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) patients confirm previous reports on patterns of chromosomal contribution to aneuploidy. The pregnancy outcomes following embryo transfer also indicate that despite the requirement to freeze embryos, rates are encouraging, and successful ongoing pregnancies can be achieved.
