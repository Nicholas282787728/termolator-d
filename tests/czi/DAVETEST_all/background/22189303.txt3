Usefulness of NT-proBNP as a heart disease marker for late-stage elderly patients receiving home medical care
The level of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide(NT-proBNP)is a strong predictor of mortality among patients with coronary heart disease, and may be a strong prognostic marker for late-stage elderly patients with heart disease receiving home medical care. We assessed the relationshipbetween NT-proBNP levels and clinical data of 240 late-stage elderly patients receiving home medical care in our clinic from May 2008 to February 2011.
