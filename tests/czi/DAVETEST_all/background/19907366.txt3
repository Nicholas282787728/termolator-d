The relationship between USMLE step 2 CS communication and interpersonal skills (CIS) ratings and the time spent by examinees interacting with standardized patients
During the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Skills exam, examinees rotate through 12 standardized patient (SP) encounters. SPs rate examinees on Communication and Interpersonal Skills (CIS). Examinees have at most 15 minutes to interact with each SP, but can end the encounter sooner. The current work assesses the relationship between CIS ratings and time examinees spend interacting with the SP. A total of 5,955 encounters from a fall 2007 sample of examinees were time-stamped to indicate total encounter time and closure time. Hierarchical linear modeling was employed to assess how well total and closure time, in conjunction with other examinee- and SP-case-related variables, predicted CIS scores. Time spent on closure had a larger impact on CIS scores than overall time used. Other variables, such as examinee gender, Spoken English Proficiency, and SP stringency, were also significantly related to CIS scores. Both time measures were significantly positively related to the CIS outcome variable, indicating a link between time used and SP satisfaction with communication, with closure time having the larger coefficient. This finding suggests that a good closure may be a lengthy one.
