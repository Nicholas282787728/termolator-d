Pigmentary lasers
The pigmentary disorders are a very heterogeneous group with a high therapeutic demand from the patients. The lasers have provided a major advance in the treatment of some pigmentary lesions. The indication and the optimal parameters are actually quite well defined. However, pigmentary lasers have limits and some dermatosis can even be worsened after laser treatment. Those limitations as well as the potential side effects have to clearly be explained to the patients that often seek for a miracle cure.
