Performance of mammography and Papanicolaou among rural women in Mexico
To analyze the frequency of reporting a recently conducted mammogram and/or pap smear and follow-up of abnormal findings among rural poor women in Mexico. We performed a cross-sectional analysis using data collected in the ENCEL 2007 - Oportunidades survey carried out between July - November, 2007. We used multilevel logistic regression to model the use of mammography and pap smears. We found a low frequency of reported recent mammogram among the rural poor from 30-39 years old (12%) and 40-49 years old (16%) and a low frequency of reported medical follow-up of abnormal findings (60%), particularly among women at higher risk because of age or abnormal findings. These findings were associated with a lack of availability of medical resources and being of indigenous origin. It is fundamental to strengthen both access to and follow-up of mammography and papsmears, particularly among high-risk rural women in order to reduce the level of mortality associated with breast and cervical-uterine cancer.
