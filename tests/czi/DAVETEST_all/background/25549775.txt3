pyNS: an open-source framework for 0D haemodynamic modelling
A number of computational approaches have been proposed for the simulation of haemodynamics and vascular wall dynamics in complex vascular networks. Among them, 0D pulse wave propagation methods allow to efficiently model flow and pressure distributions and wall displacements throughout vascular networks at low computational costs. Although several techniques are documented in literature, the availability of open-source computational tools is still limited. We here present python Network Solver, a modular solver framework for 0D problems released under a BSD license as part of the archToolkit ( http:-archtk.github.com ). As an application, we describe patient-specific models of the systemic circulation and detailed upper extremity for use in the prediction of maturation after surgical creation of vascular access for haemodialysis.
