A study of the goods supply system from hospital to outpatients with intermittent self-catheterization(ISC)
This study investigated the current status of goods supplied by medical facilities to outpatients practicing ISC. The status of goods supplied was investigated by interviewing 4 medical facilities and 26 outpatients practicing ISC, using a questionnaire. 1. Of all goods supplied for use by outpatients practicing ISC, 53. 0%were supplied by medical facilities. The outpatients bought some goods required for ISC by himself. Moreover, some goods were supplied by prescription. 2. When a hospital was consulted, while there were those to whom goods are not supplied from a hospital, there were those to whom much kinds and quantity are supplied from the hospital. As for the patient to whom many kinds and the goods of quantity are supplied, goods expense formed about 70% of ISC administration fee. In order to establish goods feed system, it was necessary to examine a common knowledge of the structure of goods supply to doctors or nurses and the validity of the ISC administration fee system from now on.
