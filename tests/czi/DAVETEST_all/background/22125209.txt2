Can any heart be preconditioned? Influence of aging and comorbidities on cardioprotection
There is experimental and clinical evidence showing that brief episodes of ischaemia and reperfusion applied either prior to prolonged ischaemia (ischaemic preconditioning), or at the onset of reperfusion (postconditioning) have the ability to protect the heart against ischaemic-reperfusion injury. The aim of this review is to discuss whether this endogenous protective mechanism is effective in the aging heart and in patients with co-morbidities.
