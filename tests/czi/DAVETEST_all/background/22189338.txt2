Self purchase of catheter supplies and the hardship associated with urinary homecare patients
The aim of our study was to clarify how catheter products are purchased by urinary homecare patients and to find problems associated with such purchases. We conducted a survey using a self-made questionnaire for 26 catheterized patients from Prefecture A, who were regular outpatients of the urology department. The results indicated that 17 patients(65. 4%)purchased catheter supplies on their own(13 males and 4 females, the mean age was 57. 9 years). The products purchased by the 26 patients were diverse including urine bags, syringes, catheters and tissues paper. Seven of the 17 patients(41%)responded that purchasing catheter supplies on their own was difficult, and 8(47%)responded that purchasing catheter supplies was an economic burden for them. The cost of purchasing catheter supplies varied greatly among the patients, and the price range was from 400 yen to 12, 000 yen. The cost was generally associated with the feelings of economic stress: it happens every month; it is a burden for some patients who need them for life time.
