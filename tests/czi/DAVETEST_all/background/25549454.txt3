Evaluation of induced mutagenesis in workers engaged into chrysotile asbestos production
The authors present data of cytogenetic study of workers engaged into chrysotile asbestos industry. Evaluation of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes of workers in main workshops of Kustanaiskie mineral JSC revealed reliable increase in chromosomal aberrations level. Structural chromosomal abnormalities in main groups were presented by chromosome and chromatide type aberrations with latter prevelent--that can prove chemical mutagenesis. Chromosome type aberrations were presented by paired fragments and centromere rupture, those of chromatide type--by deletions, single fragments and chromatide ruptures. Higher values of induced mutagenesis were revealed in workers of chrysotile asbestos ore concentration workshop, in workers of ore-preparation workshop, and in individuals with over 25 years of work at chrysotile asbestos production.
