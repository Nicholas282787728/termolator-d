Biomonitors of cardiac injury and performance: B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin as monitors of hemodynamics and oxygen transport balance
Serum biomarkers, such as B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin, are frequently measured in the cardiac intensive care unit. A review of the evidence supporting monitoring of these biomarkers is presented. A search of MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database was conducted to find literature regarding the use of B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin in the cardiac intensive care setting. Adult and pediatric data were considered. Both B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin have demonstrated utility in the intensive care setting but there is no conclusive evidence at this time that either biomarker can be used to guide inpatient management of children with cardiac disease. Although B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin concentrations can alert clinicians to myocardial stress, injury, or hemodynamic alterations, the levels can also be elevated in a variety of clinical scenarios, including sepsis. Observational studies have demonstrated that perioperative measurement of these biomarkers can predict postoperative mortality and complications. (class IIb, level of evidence B): The use of B-type natriuretic peptide and/or troponin measurements in the evaluation of hemodynamics and postoperative outcome in pediatric cardiac patients may be beneficial.
