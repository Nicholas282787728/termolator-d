Influence of Sulfuric Acid to Karst Hydrochemical and δ13CDIC in the Upper and Middle Reaches of the Wujiang River
Groundwater and surface water from the Upper and Middle Reaches of the Wujiang River were sampled and analyzed for the hydrochemistry and Carbon isotope in DIC. Then hydrochemical characteristics and the main influencing factors were investigated, and the contributions of carbonate dissolution by sulphuric acid to total(Ca2+ + Mg2+) and HCO3 were calculated using the stoichiometry method. The results showed that the advantage cations of groundwater and surface water is Ca2+, which accounted for more than 50% and the advantage anions is HCO3- and SO(4)2-, which accounted for more than 85%. The hydrochemical characteristics of most samples were of Ca-HCO3 type, and a small part of HCO3.SO4-Ca, reflecting a few samples affected by SO(4)2- from human source. The δ13CDIC of groundwater and surface water, varying from -12. 98%o to -6. 36%o with a changeable molar ratio between (Ca2+ + Mg2+) and HCO3- of 1. 11 to 1. 90, indicated that sulfuric acid has an important influence on hydrochemistry and δ3CDIC. The contributions of carbonate dissolution by sulphuric acid to total (Ca2+ + Mg2+) and HCO3 in groundwater ranged from 20. 59% to 92. 87% (average 51. 50%), and from 11. 47% to 86. 69% (average 36. 90%). While the contributions of carbonate dissolution by sulphuric acid to total (Ca2+ + Mg2+) and HCO3- in surface water ranged from 56. 14% to 94. 55% (with an average of 76. 89%), and 39. 02% to 89. 66% (with an average of 64.24%), respectively, demonstrated that sulphuric acid is an important agent of carbon rock weathering. The results of this study have a great significance for the protection and development and utilization of water resources in the Wujiang River basin and for karst carbon cycle research.
