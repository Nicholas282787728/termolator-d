Migraine and central sensitization: clinical features, main comorbidities and therapeutic perspectives
BACKGROUND Migraine is a disorder of neuro-vascular origin, being amongst the 20 most disabling disease. Migraine attacks are characterized by severe throbbing headache, associated to nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND ROLE OF CENTRAL SENSITIZATION Abnormal neuronal excitability may subtend altered processing of sensory stimuli, leading to cortical spreading depression and trigeminal activation. A dysfunction of pain modulation enhances central sensitization phenomena, contributing to acute allodynia and headache persistence. The peculiarity of migraine pain facilitates the use of analgesics, and causes an adjunctive invalidating tendency toward drug over-use. COMORBIDITY Chronic migraine patients are frequently affected by diffuse pain, framed in fibromyalgia diagnosis. This comorbidity seems to be supported by common pathophysiological mechanisms. It may aggravate migraine invalidity being worth of consideration for therapeutic management. MIGRAINE MANAGEMENT Acute and preventive treatments need to be tailored to single cases. Main comorbidity and factors facilitating central sensitization should be taken into account. The management of migraine patients should include a link between headache centers and general practitioner , in order to provide for a better patient information and treatment just at the onset of the disease. CONCLUSIONS Despite its high epidemiologic impact, migraine is frequently underestimated and destined to evolve into chronic form and drugs abuse. A more focused attention to factors facilitating central sensitization and invalidating comorbidities, should reduce the global burden of the disease.
