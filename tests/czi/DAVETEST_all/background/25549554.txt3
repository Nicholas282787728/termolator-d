Functionalized tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indoles: a novel chemotype with Sirtuin 2 inhibitory activity
Sirtuins are protein deacylases with regulatory roles in metabolism and stress response. Functionalized tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indoles were identified as preferential sirtuin 2 inhibitors, with in vitro inhibitory potencies in the low micromolar concentrations (IC50 3-4 μM) for the more promising candidates. The functional relevance of sirtuin inhibition was corroborated in western blots that showed hyperacetylation of p53 and α-tubulin in treated HepG2 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Molecular docking showed that the tetrahydropyridoindole scaffold was positioned in the NAD + pocket and the acetylated substrate channel of the sirtuin 2 protein by van der Waals/hydrophobic, H bonding and stacking interactions. Functionalized tetrahydropyridoindoles represent a novel class of sirtuin 2 inhibitors that could be further explored for its therapeutic potential.
