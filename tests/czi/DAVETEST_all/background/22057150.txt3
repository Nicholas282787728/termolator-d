Does FVIII-activity increase with age in patients with haemophilia A and carriers of haemophilia A?
The retrospective cohort study surveys the influence of age, co-morbidity and laboratory values on FVIII-activity (FVIII:C) in patients with haemophilia A with (mild n = 48, moderate n = 10, severe n = 7 and carriers n = 23). Median observation was 19 years for patients with haemophilia A and 9,5 years for carriers. FVIII:C levels collected from patients with mild haemophilia A displayed a significant median increase of 6.5% with proceeding age (p = 0.0013). Patients with moderate haemophilia A (and carriers of haemophilia A) showed a non significant median increase of 1.05% (carriers 8%). Eight patients showed FVIII:C levels at last blood withdrawal that indicated a change of severity from moderate to mild haemophilia A. A significant correlation was found between FVIII:C and VWF:RCo (p = 0.0203) and AFP (p   0.0005). The correlation between FVIII:C and triglycerides and LDH was significant negative (p   0.0005). No significant correlation could be found for FVIII:C and co-morbidity, fibrinogen, cholesterol and VWF:Ag.
