A new genus and two new species of lecanicephalidean tapeworms from the striped panray, Zanobatus schoenleinii (Rhinopristiformes: Zanobatidae), off Senegal
Recognised for their diversity in apical structure morphology, members of the cestode order Lecanicephalidea Wardle et McLeod, 1952 known to date exhibit relatively mundane and uniform acetabular morphology. A new lecanicephalidean genus, Zanobatocestus gen. n., is proposed for two new species found parasitising the spiral intestine of the striped panray, Zanobatus schoenleinii (MÃ¼ller et Henle), off Senegal that are highly unusual in acetabular morphology. Unlike the members of the 21 recognised lecanicephalidean genera, which possess simple, uniloculate suckers or bothridia, Zanobatocestus minor sp. n. and Z. major sp. n. possess biloculate bothridia. The form of their apical structures and cocoons readily distinguish the two new species from one another. Zanobatocestus minor sp. n. exhibits an apical modification of the scolex proper that is narrow and elongated, an apical organ that is small and internal, and eggs in cocoons forming linear strands, whereas Z. major sp. n. exhibits an apical modification of the scolex proper that is wide and short, an apical organ that is extensive and primarily external, and eggs in cocoons primarily as doublets with bipolar filaments. Given the typically high host specificity of lecanicephalidean cestodes, as parasites of the only genus and species currently considered valid in the family Zanobatidae, Zanobatocestus gen. n. is likely to remain one of the less specious lecanicephalidean genera.
