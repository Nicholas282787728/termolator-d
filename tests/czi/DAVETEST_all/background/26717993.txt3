The complex role of SIRT6 in carcinogenesis
SIRT6, a member of the mammalian sirtuins family, functions as a mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase and NAD(+)-dependent deacylase of both acetyl groups and long-chain fatty acyl groups. SIRT6 regulates diverse cellular functions such as transcription, genome stability, telomere integrity, DNA repair, inflammation and metabolic related diseases such as diabetes, obesity and cancer. In this review, we will discuss the implication of SIRT6 in the biology of cancer and the relevance to organism homeostasis and lifespan.
