ORALMEDIC® for treatment of aphthous stomatitis--possible side effects with repeated applications
ORALMEDIC® (HybenX, Epien Medical Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is a relatively recent commercial agent designated for the treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS). It has the potential to safely and effectively reduce pain associated with RAS. We present two patients who used ORALMEDIC® to reduce pain caused by RAS lesions. Both patients developed side effects presenting as deep ulcerations with a necrotic base at the location where ORALMEDIC® has been repeatedly applied as pain did not diminish after the first application. One patient used ORALMEDIC® several times on the same lesion. However the other patient followed the manufacturer instructions when he successively used ORALMEDIC® stick twice over the same lesion. Patients were treated with systemic antibiotics and local antiseptic agents. The healing process of the ulcers was slow and has completed its course within six weeks. It is suggested that when dental surgeons recommend ORALMEDIC®, they should emphasize the importance of using this agent according to the manufacturer's instructions in order to minimize the risk for side effects.
