Structural Studies of Component of Lysoamidase Bacteriolytic Complex from Lysobacter sp. XL1
The lysoamidase bacteriolytic complex (LBC) comprising five enzymes (L1-L5) is secreted into the culture liquid by gram-negative bacterium Lysobacter sp. XL1. The medicinal agent lysoamidase has a broad-antimicrobial spectrum. Bacteriolytic protease L1 belongs to the LBC. Recombinant L1 protease of Lysobacter sp. XL1 was expressed, purified to homogeneity and crystallized. The X-ray structure of L1 at 1.35 Å resolution has been determined using the synchrotron data and the molecular replacement method. L1 protease is a thermostable whose thermal unfolding proceeds in one step without forming stable intermediates. Structural information concerning L1 will contribute to the development of new-generation antimicrobial drugs, whose application will not be accompanied by the selection of resistant microorganisms.
