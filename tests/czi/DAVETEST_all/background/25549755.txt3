Comparison of Pipelle sampler with conventional dilatation and curettage (D&C) for Chinese endometrial biopsy
The aim of this study is to investigate the accuracy and adequacy of the Pipelle endometrial sampler for endometrial biopsy as compared with those of conventional dilatation and curettage (D&C). A total of 245 patients subject to endometrial biopsy were included in this study. We have shown that the failure rates with D&C and Pipelle were 7.75% and 8.98%, respectively, without statistical difference. Additionally, the obtained specimen quality and accurate diagnosis of various diseases using the two methods had no significant statistical differences. Furthermore, patients experienced less pain when Pipelle sampler was used than D&C. Therefore, Pipelle sampler is effective in obtaining adequate endometrial tissue for histodiagnosis, and is applicable in most of the cases for Chinese endometrial biopsy.
