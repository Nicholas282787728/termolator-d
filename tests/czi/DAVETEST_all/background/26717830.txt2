Preparation and retention mechanism exploration of mesostructured cellular foam silica as stationary phase for high performance liquid chromatography
Siliceous mesostructured cellular foam (MCF) with highly interconnected porous structure, ultralarge pore size and relatively uniform particle size (3-5μm) was prepared to achieve the mixed-mode and efficient separation of intact proteins. And molecular sieving effect for the first time played an important role in protein separation using mesoporous silica materials as HPLC stationary phase. The spherical silica particles were synthesized via hydrothermal method and the pore size was easily regulated by adding NH4F as well as altering the aging time. After aminopropyl derivatization, the chromatographic performance of functionalized mesoporous silica particles was investigated in comparison with those without modification and commercial NH2 column, and their mixed-mode retention mechanisms were investigated in detail. The superior separation performance for the retention of proteins was obtained on our home-made column in comparison with commercial NH2 column. The influences of aminopropyl derivatization and mobile phase composition on the column property were also investigated. Moreover, the home-made column showed similar performance for separation of polar anilines and neutral PAHs with the commercial column, owing to mixed-mode retention mechanisms including p-π stacking, electron interaction, hydrophobic effect, π-π EDA interaction and hydrogen bonding. All these results indicated that the aminopropyl modified MCF would be promising in the mixed-mode and efficient separation of biomolecules in addition with small molecules.
