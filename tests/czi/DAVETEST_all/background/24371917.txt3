Midwife-led continuity models versus other models of care for childbearing women
The aim of this bi-monthly column is to highlight Cochrane Systematic Reviews of relevance to pregnancy and childbirth and to stimulate discussion on the relevance and implications of the review for practice. The Cochrane Collaboration is an international organisation that prepares and maintains high quality systematic reviews to help people make well-informed decisions about healthcare and health policy. A systematic review tries to search for, appraise and bring together existing research to answer a specific research quesiton. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) is published monthly online. Residents in countries with a national licence to the Cochrane Libray, including the U.K. and Ireland, can access the Cochrane Library online, free of charge through www.thecochranelibrary.com.
