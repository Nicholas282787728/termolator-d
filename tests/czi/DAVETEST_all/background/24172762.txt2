Blepharoptosis
Blepharoptosis of the upper eyelid is a common condition among patients presenting for oculoplastic surgery. Although there are many types of ptosis, the two most frequent clinical cases are simple congenital ptosis in young patients and senile ptosis in adults. Patient examination is important to distinguish these from other more infrequent types of ptosis, such as those neurogenic, myogenic and posttraumatic. These latter cases may require specific therapeutic strategies. Ptosis can usually be corrected surgically. The article discusses guidelines for the choice of intervention. Various different surgical techniques are also presented, together with results and complications.
