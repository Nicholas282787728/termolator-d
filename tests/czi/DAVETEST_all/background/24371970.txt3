Obstacles in wound healing
Wound healing is a complex process that involves a significant number of chemical and physiological events acting on the cellular and molecular level. Wound healing passes through four stages, which are not distinctly separated one from another. There are many factors that can affect the wound healing process and their activities slow down, or completely interrupt the healing process. Wound around tissue ischemia, which is due to spasm of the arteries or atherosclerotic changes in them, can easily lead to slowing down or even stops the wound healing process. Wound infections and use of corticosteroids are significant barriers to healing. Other factors that can influence the course of wound healing are inadequate nutrition with consequent lack of energy or protein and some vitamins, wound abidance, wound bed status, localization of wound, etc. Only with the knowledge of the wound healing pathophysiology and understanding all the factors that may affect delayed wound healing, we can adequately prevent and treat chronic wounds.
