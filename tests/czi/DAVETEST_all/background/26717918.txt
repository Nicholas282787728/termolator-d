Hepatoprotective Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine on Liver Fibrosis from Ethanol Administration following Partial Hepatectomy
The aim of this study was to establish the effective hepatoprotective properties of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) in fibrotic rat liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PHx). Fibrosis was induced in rats by ethanol (EtOH, 5 ml/kg) administration for 6, 24, 72, and 168 h. The rats were then fed four TCMs (1 g/kg/day, Codonopsis pilosula (CP), Salvia miltorrhiza Bunge (SMB), Bupleurum kasi (BK), and Elephantopus scaber L (ESL)) to Spraque-Dawley rats for 6, 24, 72 and 168 h, respectively. Surgical 70% cirrhotic fibrosis PHx was then conducted at 6, 24, 72, and 168 h. The effects on liver regeneration were examined to estimate and measure hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, and retinoblastoma protein (pRb) protein expression using Western blotting analysis. Cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 mRNA by Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were analyzed in cirrhotic fibrosis rats. Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, pRb and E2F mRNA expression levels were determined in fibrotic rats following PHx using RT-PCR. We found elevated glutamyl oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamyl pyrubic transaminase (GPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gammaglutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), glutathione (GSH), nonprotein sulfhydryl (NPSH) and total bilirubin in serum after 6 h EtOH administration. These levels were progressively decreased over 168 h. Total protein and albumin were reduced in serum after 6 h administration and then progressively increased. In contrast, tissues disorder histology and morphology were determined in liver sections. After rats were fed TCMs we found that SMB extraction not only induced HGF, FAK, Cyclin D1, and pRb protein expression and Cyclin D1 mRNA increases, but also reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 after 24 and 72 h post injury. In the cell cycle S phase the Cyclin E protein expression was increased by ESL. CP induced TIMP-1, TIMP-2 and TIMP-3 mRNA increases in fibrotic rats. We detected liver regeneration in fibrotic rats. We also found that the liver regeneration index increased from 6 to 168 h post PHx. After 168 h fibrotic liver regeneration rats exhibited reduced TGF-β1 mRNA expression and enhanced Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, pRb and E2F mRNA expression. TCMs play a crucial role in the early mediating process in fibrotic rat liver regeneration after PHx.
