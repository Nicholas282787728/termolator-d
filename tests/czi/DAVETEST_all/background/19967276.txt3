Regional differences in breast and cervical cancer mortality in Mexico between 1979-2006
Explore the regional differences in breast (BC) and cervical cancer (CC) mortality in Mexico. We estimated mortality trends for BC and CC using probabilistic models adjusted by state marginalization level and urban and rural residence. BC mortality shows a rising trend, from a rate of 5.6 deaths per 100000 women in 1979 to 10.1 in 2006. The CC mortality rate reached a peak in 1989 and after this decreased significantly to 9.9 in 2006. The highest BC mortality rates are found in Mexico City (13.2) and the northern part of the country (11.8). As for CC, the highest mortality rates are found in the south (11.9 per 100000 women the). The number of BC cases are increased gradually at the national level during the last three decades and high rates of CC mortality persist in marginalized areas.
