SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA WITH CLOACAL EXSTROPHY: A CASE REPORT
A 41-year-old man with a history of cloacal exstrophy presented to a local clinic with abdominal pain and bowel sounds. He was noted to have pain at the site of scarring due to cloacal exstrophy and a laceration at its center, which was stained with feces. He was referred to our department because of an enterocutaneous fistula. Skin biopsy of the neoplastic lesion at this site led to a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Computed tomography showed tumor invasion of the ileum and right inguinal lymph node enlargement. We performed tumor resection, partial enterectomy, intestinal anastomosis, abdominal wall reconstruction with a left pedicled anterolateral thigh flap, split-thickness skin grafting, and right inguinal lymph node biopsy. Histopathological examination revealed cancer growth, invasion, and pearl formation in the lymph nodes, leading to a diagnosis of abdominal squamous cell carcinoma with metastasis to the inguinal lymph nodes. The skin graft took well, and the patient was discharged. He is scheduled for right inguinal lymph node dissection at a later date.
