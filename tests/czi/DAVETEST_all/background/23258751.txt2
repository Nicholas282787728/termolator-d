Induced abortion and labor activity. Reflections for discussion
The induced abortion is a global phenomenon that according to various authors respond to socially constructed patterns of behavior and where they influence social realities of each country. This phenomenon requires the information necessary to understand the complex process leading to the decision of women to opt for abortion and able to understand the social, economic and health that can explain this requirement. For this purpose is presented for discussion, some considerations on voluntary abortion and labor activity of women who opt for this practice, with special mention of the situation in Spain. The arguments are supported by statistical analysis of the voluntary interruption of pregnancy (IVE) reported by the Ministry of Health and Social Policy, participation of women in the labor market in Spain obtained from the National Statistics Institute (INE), the research results on the association between employment status of women and voluntary termination of pregnancy and comprehensive review of scientific literature on the different perspectives of the approach of voluntary abortion. Analysis deserves special importance of women's work activity as a possible factor in the decision of women to terminate their pregnancies, a variable that has been identified in most of the investigations as a socioeconomic condition for women who choose for that alternative, considering that pregnancy interferes with the employment of women or, rather, prevents them from use.
