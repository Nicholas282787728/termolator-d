Modulation of p53 binding to MDM2: computational studies reveal important roles of Tyr100
The tumor suppressor protein p53 is regulated by the ubiquitin ligase MDM2 which down-regulates p53. In tumours with overexpressed MDM2, the p53-MDM2 interaction can be interrupted by a peptide or small molecule to stabilize p53 as a therapeutic strategy. Structural and biochemical/mutagenesis data show that p53 has 3 hydrophobic residues F19, W23 and L26 that embed into the ligand binding pocket of MDM2 which is highly plastic in nature and can modulate its size to accommodate a variety of ligands. This binding pocket is primarily dependent on the orientation of a particular residue, Y100. We have studied the role of the dynamics of Y100 in p53 recognition. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the Y100 side chain can be in open or closed states with only the former enabling complex formation. When both p53 and MDM2 are in near native conformations, complex formation is rapid and is driven by the formation of a hydrogen bond between W23 of p53 and L54 of MDM2 or by the embedding of F19 of p53 into MDM2. The transition of Y100 from closed to open can increase the size of the binding site. Interconversions between these two states can be induced by the N-terminal region of MDM2 or by the conformations of the p53 peptides. Molecular dynamics simulations have revealed how the binding of p53 to MDM2 is modulated by the conformational mobility of Y100 which is the gatekeeper residue in MDM2. The mobility of this residue can be modulated by the conformations of p53 and the Nterminal lid region of MDM2.
