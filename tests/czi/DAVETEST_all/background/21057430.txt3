Functional brain imaging in suicidal patients
A systematic review of comparative neuroimaging studies of suicidal brains was carried out. Changes in the structure and functions of the brain in association with suicidal behaviour are mainly found in the orbitofrontal and dorsolateral parts of the prefrontal cortex. These changes are related to neuropsychological disturbances in decision-making, problem solving and fluency.
