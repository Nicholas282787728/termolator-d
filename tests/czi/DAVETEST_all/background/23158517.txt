Update of adjustable fortification regimen for preterm infants: a new protocol
Preterm infants fed fortified human milk in standard fashion receive less protein than they need due to customary assumptions. Protein is limiting for growth and neurocognitive development,and shortfalls of protein are not acceptable. Adjustable fortification regimen has been proven as an effective way to provide adequate protein intakes and appropriate growth in this group of infants. Italian Association of Human Milk Banks (AIBLUD) has promoted and implemented this Adjustable fortification regimen in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) with success. This paper presents an update of Adjustable fortification regimen; a new protocol already utilized in several italian NICUs.
