The role of i.v. ibandronate administration in osteoporosis therapy
Osteoporosis is a chronic disease of the osseous system characterised by decreased strength of bone tissue, which in turn leads to increased fracture risk. It has been demonstrated that osteoporosis affects more than 30% of women after the menopause (World Health Organization, 1994). However, the disease is also observed in men. The primary goals of osteoporosis therapy include prevention of low-energy fractures and general improvement of quality of life. Any patient with diagnosed osteoporosis requires, besides prevention, the application of proper treatment. Of the available therapeutic options, the best are bisphosphonates, medical agents with well identified properties, therapeutic efficacy, and safety which has been confirmed in many clinical studies. Therefore, they are recommended as first line drugs for osteoporosis. The efficacy of oral preparations may be limited, due to low bioavailability, complications and adverse effects from the gastrointestinal tract. So the parenteral administration of bisphosphonates is a valuable alternative. A fine example of such therapy is the intravenous administration of ibandronate. Short injection time periods and the relatively long, three-month intervals between administrations are unquestionable advantages of this therapy mode. In addition, the therapy does not constrain a patient's everyday activity, and simultaneously provides regular contact with doctors and the therapeutic centre. Additionally, a good tolerance of the drug and its high therapeutic efficacy, proven by appreciably reduced fracture risks, significantly improves the quality of life of patients suffering from osteoporosis. This paper is a thorough review of current knowledge on the efficacy and safety of i.v. ibandronate in osteoporosis therapy, as presented in the latest literature reports.
