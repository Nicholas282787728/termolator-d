The suppression of a herpes simplex virus reproduction with drug resistance by combination 15lys-bis-nt and phosphate of acycloguanosine with some antiherpetic drugs
Antiherpetic activity of the double and triple combinations, including original connections 15Lys-bis-Nt and phosphate of acycloguanosine (P-ACG), was studied in vitro. For the first time, it was demonstrated that in case of their combined use with known antiherpetic agents, whose activity does not depend on TK of HSV (PFA, AraA, CDV, Rib, GLN, Î±a-IFN), synergistic or additive effects of interaction was observed. The antiviral effect of the tested combinations was studied on the model of ACG-resistant viral strain. The tested combinations could be of interest for practical medicine.
