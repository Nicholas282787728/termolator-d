Metabolic and organ protective properties of various infusion solutions and the choice of starting therapy in the pre-admission stage of acetic acid poisoning
We conducted an open prospective study in 60 patients (30 men and 30 women) with acetic acid poisoning. A randomization was performed on the groups, taking into account the tactics of infusion therapy: group I--15 patients who did not receive an infusion therapy at a pre-admission stage; group II--15 patients who received the infiusion therapy with solution of sodium chloride 0.9%; group III--15 patients who received the infusion therapy with modified gelatin (Gelofusinwn), group IV-15 patients who received the infusion therapy with reamberinum. We found that the most favorable results were noted in patients of group IV in the early posttraumatic period.
