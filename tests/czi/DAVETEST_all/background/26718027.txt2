Pro-apoptotic effects of splice-switching oligonucleotides targeting Bcl-x pre-mRNA in human glioma cell lines
Alternative splicing is a near-ubiquitous phenomenon with important roles in human diseases, including cancers. Splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) have emerged as a class of antisense therapeutics that modulate alternative splicing by hybridizing to the pre-mRNA splice site. The Bcl-x gene is alternatively spliced to express anti‑apoptotic Bcl-xL and pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS. Bcl-xL expression is upregulated in many cancers and is considered a general mechanism by which cancer cells evade apoptosis. By redirecting Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing from Bcl-xL to Bcl-xS, SSO exerted pro-apoptotic and chemosensitizing effects in various cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated the effects of SSO targeting Bcl-x pre-mRNA in human glioma cell lines. First, we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of Bcl-xL in glioma cell lines (U87 and U251) and a normal human astrocyte cell line (HA1800). Then, the Bcl-x SSO was designed to bind to the downstream 5' alternative splice site of exon 2 in Bcl-x pre-mRNA and was modified using 2'-O-methoxyethyl-phosphorothioate. An oligonucleotide targeting aberrantly spliced human β-globin intron was used as a negative control. The SSOs were delivered with a cationic lipid into glioma and astrocyte cell lines. The antitumor effects of the SSOs were assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays and flow cytometry, and the switch in production from Bcl-xL to Bcl-xS was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting. Bcl-xL mRNA and protein were highly expressed in both glioma cell lines. The Bcl-x SSO modified Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing and had pro-apoptotic effects on the glioma cell lines. By contrast, the lipid alone and the control SSO did not affect Bcl-xL expression or induce apoptosis. Our study demonstrated the antitumor activity of an SSO that targets Bcl-x pre-mRNA splicing in glioma cell lines. Bcl-x SSO may be a potential strategy for treating gliomas.
