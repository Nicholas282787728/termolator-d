Genomic basis for breast cancer: advances in personalized medicine
Genomic analysis of breast cancer has allowed the development of new tools for the prediction of recurrence and the response to treatment of this disease. Gene expression profiles allow better tumor classification, identifying tumor subgroups with particular clinical outcomes. New potential molecular targets involved in breast carcinogenesis have also been identified through the analysis of DNA copy number aberrations and microRNA expression patterns. Whole genome association studies have identified genetic variants associated with a higher risk to develop this tumor, providing more information for public health decisions. Progress in DNA sequencing methods will also allow for the analysis of all the genetic alterations present in a tumor. In this review, we describe the current state of genomic research in breast cancer as well as how these findings are being translated into clinical practice, contributing to development of personalized medicine.
