Use of negative pressure therapy in the treatment of primary infected traumatic wounds of the foot caused by high energy impact
Foot injuries caused by firearms and high pressure washing machines are not common, but due to high energy can be very destructive and contaminated with microorganisms. Due to the anatomical specificity of the foot, injures of the specific structure such as blood vessels, nerves and tendon-ligament apparatus are frequent. Soft tissue defect is often present. Functional and aesthetic recovery of the foot is a challenge for the surgeon. Direct and indirect effect of the negative pressure therapy helps in wound healing and provides good preparation for definitive surgical management of wounds.
