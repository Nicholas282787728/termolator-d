Investigation of nutriactive phytochemical - gamma-oryzanol in experimental animal models
Gamma-oryzanol (GO) is an abundant dietary antioxidant that is considered to have beneficial effects in cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes. Other potential properties of GO include inhibition of gastric acid secretion and decreased post-exercise muscle fatigue. GO is a unique mixture of triterpene alcohol and sterol ferulates present in rice bran oil, a byproduct of rice processing. GO has been studied by many researchers over the last three decades. In particular, the utility of GO supplementation has been documented in numerous animal models. A large variety of species was examined, and various experimental methodologies and targets were applied. The aim of this study was to summarize the body of research on GO supplementation in animals and to examine possible mechanisms of GO action. Furthermore, while the safety of GO supplementation in animals has been well documented, studies demonstrating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficiency are less clear. The observed differences in these findings are also discussed.
