Lactate and acid base as a hemodynamic monitor and markers of cellular perfusion
: The intra- and postoperative monitoring of lactate and acid-base has been advocated in pediatric cardiac critical care as surrogate markers of cardiac output, oxygen delivery, and cellular perfusion. Many clinicians use lactate and base excess routinely as markers of tissue perfusion and to assess the effectiveness of their intervention. This review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of using these measurements in pediatric cardiac critical care. : A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Database was conducted to find controlled trials of lactate and base excess. Adult and pediatric data were considered. Guidelines published by the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Heart Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation were reviewed including further review of references cited. : Many factors other than tissue hypoxia may contribute to hyperlactemia in critical illness. Although the presence of hyperlactemia on admission appears to be associated with intensive care unit mortality and morbidity in some retrospective analyses, significant overlap between survivors and nonsurvivors means that nonsurvivors cannot be predicted from admission lactate measurement. Persistently elevated postoperative lactate is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the pediatric cardiac population. To date there is no randomized control trial of goal-directed therapy in adult or pediatric cardiac care that includes normalization of lactate as a target. Overall equivalent time measurements of base excess, anion gap, and pH have a low predictive value for morbidity and mortality in children after cardiac surgery. Lactate is one of a cluster of markers of cellular perfusion and oxygen delivery. Alone, as a single measurement, it has minimal predictive value and is nondiscriminatory for survival.
