Motivating health education-based change
The following work refers to academic experience regarding the training of nurses concerning primary prevention and child nursing within the area of public health. The target population consisted of children. Accumulated experience was systematized for identifying epistemological, theoretical and practical elements developed over five years in basic primary education institutions, in line with the educational proposal Experience sexuality with dignity. It was found that this type of work managed to develop special motivation in the scholastic community whilst allowing academics to approach the social reality which they must confront in their professional practice. The work emphasised strengthening children's awareness of the need for family, state and civil society participation. Motivating health education-based change did involve the systematisation of experience as a methodological tool.
