Territorial translation of the National Health and Nutrition Program in Midi-Pyrénées, France
Inspired by the Hygienist Movement, which associates good health with regular, moderate exercise, the National Health and Nutrition Program identifies a lack of physical activity as a risk factor for many chronic diseases. As such, the Program encourages people to take care of their bodies by inciting a moral obligation to develop a physically active lifestyle and follow a healthy diet. With the overall goal of improving the health of the population by acting on nutrition, the Program focuses on primary prevention, screening and early treatment of conditions like heart disease, cancer, obesity, osteoporosis and diabetes. As an incentive program developed in keeping with the biopolitical views of the 1970s that saw education as an alternative means to hospitals for achieving good health, the Program is also a good public action tool for controlling costs.
