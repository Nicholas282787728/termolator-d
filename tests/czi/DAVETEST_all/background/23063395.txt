1,25Dihydroxy vitamin D(3) improves titanium implant osseointegration in osteoporotic rats
This study aimed to investigate the effects of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) on implant osseointegration in osteoporotic rats. Twelve weeks after bilateral ovariectomy, each rat had 2 titanium screws implanted in the proximal tibiae. All animals were then randomly divided into 2 groups: control (10 rats) and 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) (10 rats). 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) was administered through oral gavage at 0.1 μg/kg/d, and control animals were given vehicle. Eight weeks later, tibiae with screws were harvested for μCT, histologic, and biomechanical analysis. Compared with control, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) increased percent bone volume by 96.0%, percent osseointegration by 94.4%, mean trabecular number by 112.5%, mean trabecular thickness by 51.8%, trabecular connective density by 38.0%, and decreased trabecular separation by 39.3% in μCT analysis. The 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) increased bone area density by 1.2-fold and bone-to-implant contact by 1.5-fold in histomorphometry, and increased the maximal push-out force by 2.0-fold in biomechanical test. The 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) improves implant osseointegration in osteoporotic rats.
