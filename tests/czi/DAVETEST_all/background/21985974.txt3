Role of calcium-sensing receptor in bone biology
Extracellular calcium concentration changes are recognized by Ca++ sensing receptor (CaR), a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. Recently, progress has been made in the understanding of CaR functional role in bone cells, notwithstanding a lack of detailed knowledge about the identity of the cation receptors. It is generally agreed that a high extracellular calcium induces osteoblast proliferation and osteoclastogenesis inhibition. Potential implications that may be considered include a role for CaR in osteogenesis, in serum calcium homeostasis regulation, and as a factor coupling bone formation to resorption in bone remodeling. The localization of CaR in bone cells provides further knowledge of the mechanisms operating in the bone remodeling model; in fact, increased calcium gradient in the site of bone resorption favors osteoblast precursors chemotaxis and inhibits osteoclasts through the increase of [Ca++]e. In vitro data indicate that CaR is a physiological regulator of bone cells, regulating the recruitment, differentiation and survival of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. This leads to the concept that the CaR present in bone cells may be targeted by agonists or antagonists to control bone cell metabolism and bone remodeling.
