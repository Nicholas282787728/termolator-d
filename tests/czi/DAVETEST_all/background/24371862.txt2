The lazy lateral incision: an innovative approach to the skin-sparing mastectomy
The skin-sparing mastectomy has many advantages over a simple mastectomy, including preservation of the native breast skin, inframammary fold, and improved aesthetics for immediate reconstruction. The traditional transverse elliptical access incision is anterior on the breast mound, requires a second incision for previous biopsy sites, and provides restricted access to the axilla. We describe a novel mastectomy incision that improves scar appearance, improves access to the axillary contents, and reduces skin flap retraction. This incision starts at the nipple-areolar complex and extends laterally in a curvilinear fashion toward the axilla incorporating the biopsy scar along the way. This simple sinusoidal design results in an aesthetically superior alternative to the traditional linear mastectomy incision.
