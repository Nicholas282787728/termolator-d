Rehabilitation in rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis: differences and similarities
The aim of the paper is to summarize and compare the best available evidence concerning the effectiveness of rehabilitative interventions and provide an overview of recommendations or international guidelines on non-pharmacological treatments in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS).It was found that, compared to RA, there are relatively fewer non-pharmacological intervention studies in AS. Overall, the literature on the effectiveness of non-pharmacological treatment modalities in RA and AS supports the use of exercise and educational interventions with a cognitive behavioural component. The evidence on electro-physical modalities, balneotherapy, and dietary interventions and alternative or complementary interventions for managing RA and AS is generally weak or inconclusive.International practice guidelines on RA and AS management recommend non-pharmacological interventions as adjunctive interventions to medications.Areas for future research include non-pharmacological interventions in AS, studies on the effectiveness and costs of various health care delivery models, and the usage of alternative or complementary treatments.
