Using community-based participatory approaches to mobilize communities for policy change
The Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) Alabama Breast and Cervical Cancer Coalition used community-based participatory research principles to address breast and cervical cancer disparities among Alabama's most vulnerable African American communities. With funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Alabama Breast and Cervical Cancer Coalition implemented a multilevel action plan, which entailed disseminating evidence-based strategies to community organizations interested in addressing cancer and other health disparities. Based on the Alabama Breast and Cervical Cancer Coalition's technical assistance on advocacy, an independent, community-led coalition was formed. This article uses a case study approach to document the steps taken by this empowered coalition to mobilize their community to impact cancer disparities using community-based participatory research principles as a tool to change tobacco and breast and cervical cancer legislation.
