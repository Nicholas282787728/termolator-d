Using supervision to protect vulnerable families
Sandwell Health Visiting Service identified difficulties in recruiting and retaining health visiting staff and fully meeting the needs of vulnerable families. Following the Laming report, the decision was made to introduce health visiting supervision leads. This resulted in improvements in record keeping and care planning and in better protection and support for vulnerable families.
