Age-related and situation-related social desirability responding among Chinese teachers
Social desirability responding (SDR) was affected by situation and age. However, most research is only concerned with overall SDR without considering the separation of impression management and self-deception. The purpose of this article is to explore the possible different effects of age and situation on the different components of SDR. A total of 158 teachers completed the BIDR at a 2 (high vs. low SDR situation) x 2 (20-29 vs. 30-39 years old) between-group experiment. The results of multivariate analyses, with gender and tenure controlled, suggested that the effects of age and situation on the four specific components were mixed. Impression management enhancement (IME) and denial (IMD) were significantly affected by situations. The older group had significantly higher self-deception enhancement (SDE) and IME scores than the younger one. Females had significantly higher IME scores than males. More age stages and the main effect of gender should be considered in the future.
