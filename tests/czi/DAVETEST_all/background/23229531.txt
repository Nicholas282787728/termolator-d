Bone ultrasonography in kidney disease: applications and limitations
Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) of the bone is a technique that is generating great interest among bone structure researchers because of its intrinsic features. Its safety and low cost make it an ideal technique for repeated measurements over time such as in chronic disease or when it is necessary to monitor the effects of prescribed therapies. The method was developed for the study of osteoporosis and the sites of measurement are all peripheral, including the distal diaphyses and metaphyses of the phalanges, calcaneus, radius and tibia. QUS parameters, however, cannot be used directly for the diagnosis of osteoporosis according to the WHO criteria, although many authors have shown that ultrasound parameters, particularly those of calcaneal QUS, can predict the risk of osteoporotic fractures independently of MBD. Very promising results with the use of QUS have been obtained in corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Cushing's syndrome, cystic fibrosis, osteomalacia, thalassemia and osteopenia related to parenteral nutrition. QUS can also monitor the effectiveness of therapy in various pathological conditions. In nephrology the combined use of phalangeal QUS and biochemical markers of bone turnover allows adequate follow-up of patients on dialysis and renal transplant recipients with alterations or disorders of the bone.
