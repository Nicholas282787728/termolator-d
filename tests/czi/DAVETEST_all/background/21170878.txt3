Dyselectrolytemias and arrhythmias
Critical care patients are submitted to multiple derangements of vital parameters. Even in patients with a normally performing heart, its electrical activity can be strongly influenced by dyselectrolytemias, acid-base imbalance and aggressive drug therapy. In this paper, the basic principles of the electrophysiologic properties of the heart are reviewed, and the impact of dyselectrolytemias on heart excitability are underlined. Some clinically relevant aspects are described in greater depth, with respect to life-threatening arrhythmias.
