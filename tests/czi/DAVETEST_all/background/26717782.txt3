PROCEDURE AND FEASIBILITY OF LAPAROSCOPIC RENAL BIOPSY
Recently, laparoscopic surgery is the standard procedure in urological field. We report the experience of laparoscopic renal biopsy for 4 patients who have contraindication of ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy. We retrospectively reviewed the patients who underwent laparoscopic renal biopsy (LRB) from March 2010 to June 2013 in our hospital. Four female with mean age of 54.5 years old underwent LRB. Two patients had solitary kidney and the other 2 patients had bleeding tendency. All the biopsy was performed retroperitoneal approach. We used 18-gauge biopsy needle to take renal cortical tissue in all cases. In addition, one patient underwent small wedge biopsy with a cold knife. Mean operative time, pneumoperitoneal time, and estimated blood loss was 63.0 min (range 48-92 min), 37.5 min (range 22-75), and 11.25 ml (range 0-30 ml), respectively. No perioperative complication was observed. In all cases, we can diagnose pathologically by LRB. LRB is safe, effective, and feasible procedure for the patients in whom ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy is contraindication.
