Sutureless intestinal anastomosis with a novel device of magnetic compression anastomosis
To explore the feasibility and efficiency of a novel magnetic compression anastomats (MCAs) in intestinal anastomosis. A total of 36 male mongrel canines underwent intestinal anastomosis using traditional hand-sewn (n=18) or a novel MCAs (n= 18). We compared the anastomosis time, postoperative complications, bursting strength of anastomoses, gross appearance, and pathology between two groups at each timepoint of follow-up. The mean anastomosis time with MCAs was significantly less than that with hand-sewn (8.50 +/- 1.95 vs. 31.1 +/- 4.32 minutes, P 0.001). The blood stools and intussusceptions occurred in both groups during follow-up period. Only 1 mongrel canine receiving intestinal anastomosis by MCAs experienced anastomotic leakage. The average bursting pressure of anastomoses obtained from mongrel canines undergoing intestinal anastomosis by MCAs was significantly higher than that by traditional hand-sewn at 1 week's follow-up time (P 0.05). Gross appearance of the anastomoses constructed by MCAs was relatively smoother and flatter. Pathological evalution of anastomoses revealed that general inflammation was greater in hand-sewn anastomoses than magnetic anastomosis. The magnetic compression anastomat is a safe and effective device of sutureless intestinal anastomosis in canine models.
