DNA structural features and architecture of promoter regions play a role in gene responsiveness of S. cerevisiae
Gene expression is the most fundamental biological process, which is essential for phenotypic variation. It is regulated by various external (environment and evolution) and internal (genetic) factors. The level of gene expression depends on promoter architecture, along with other external factors. Presence of sequence motifs, such as transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and TATA-box, or DNA methylation in vertebrates has been implicated in the regulation of expression of some genes in eukaryotes, but a large number of genes lack these sequences. On the other hand, several experimental and computational studies have shown that promoter sequences possess some special structural properties, such as low stability, less bendability, low nucleosome occupancy, and more curvature, which are prevalent across all organisms. These structural features may play role in transcription initiation and regulation of gene expression. We have studied the relationship between the structural features of promoter DNA, promoter directionality and gene expression variability in S. cerevisiae. This relationship has been analyzed for seven different measures of gene expression variability, along with two different regulatory effect measures. We find that a few of the variability measures of gene expression are linked to DNA structural properties, nucleosome occupancy, TATA-box presence, and bidirectionality of promoter regions. Interestingly, gene responsiveness is most intimately correlated with DNA structural features and promoter architecture.
