Ectropion, entropion, trichiasis
Aim of this review was to describe ectropion, entropion and trichiasis and their therapy. These eyelid pathologies are characterised by common symptoms (redness, excessive tearing and irritation of the eye) and by altered balance of the anterior and posterior lamellae of the eyelids. They involve more frequently the inferior eyelid and the therapy is mainly surgical. Parasurgical therapy may play a role as a temporary measure.
