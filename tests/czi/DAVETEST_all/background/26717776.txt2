Determination of 22 Elements in Herb Tea by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry
N, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr, Ba and Pb in herb tea were determined by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry with pressed powder pellets. The measuring conditions of target elements were investigated, including how to select its analytical line. In addition to Ba and Pb using L line, Kalpha line was selected for the rest. When the Compton scattered radiation of Rh Kalpha was measured, The X-ray tube voltage should be appropriately reduced, and the appropriate tube current should be selected. The matrix effect was corrected by empirical coefficient method and using scattered radiation (the Rayleigh scattered radiation of Rh Lalpha, the scattered background of 0.1876 nm wavelength position and the Compton scattered radiation of Rh Kalpha) as internal standard, and the spectral overlapping interference of some elements (N, Na, Ca, Ti, Mn, Sr and Ba) was corrected. For the target elements, the detection limit of this method was low, and its accuracy and precision were high. The results showed that there were abandon of elements in herb tea, of which different kinds had different components, even the same kind of herb tea with different source had some difference in element and content more or less, however, there was a lot of similarity between the features of its components. In a word, this method could achieve multi-element determination of herb tea, and it was simple in operation, low cost, rapid, and accurate.
