Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and epilepsy in childhood
Both attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and epilepsy are common disorders in childhood. ADHD and epilepsy can be detrimental to the behavior, learning and social relations of affected children. Children with epilepsy and ADHD tend to be at higher risk of school difficulties compared with children who suffer from epilepsy only. We review the works on the prevalence of ADHD in the epileptic population, the prevalence of epilepsy in children with ADHD, and electroencephalographic abnormalities observed in patients with ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD in childhood epilepsy is higher than in the general population and as is the rate of epilepsy in ADHD. Further studies are required to assess the bidirectional relationship between ADHD and epilepsy and the impact of electroencephalographic abnormalities in the clinical course of these patients.
