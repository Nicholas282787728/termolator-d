Getting the patients' perspective: a survey of diabetes services on Guam
The prevention and control of diabetes is a major public health priority for the US Territory of Guam. As part of a strategic planning process, a survey of diabetes patients was conducted to determine patients' perceptions of the availability and adequacy of preventive and clinical services to control diabetes. A total of 125 survey questionnaires were distributed to diabetes patients attending either one of the Guam Department of Public Health and Social Services Community Health Centers or a private Internal Medicine/Endocrinology clinical practice of the only endocrinologist on the island. All 125 questionnaires were returned. Respondents were highly aware of the duration of their diabetes, and almost 75% have had the opportunity to discuss the chronic nature of the illness and the importance of key lifestyle changes to help prevent or retard the progression of the disease. However, almost 40% of patients were not aware of the type of diabetes they had, and one in five have not received diabetes self-management education from their health care providers. Key interventions, such as nutritional counseling, brief tobacco cessation interventions, regular eye and foot examinations and immunization services were not being provided to 30% to 60% of patients, despite clinical practice guidelines that recommend these interventions for all diabetics. While over half of respondents were generally satisfied with the quality of preventive and routine medical care that they receive from their service providers, they identified the need for better quality diabetes self-management education, preventive services, enhanced access to specialists and specialized care, especially for diabetes-related complications, and better financial support to assist them in meeting the costs of chronic care and medications. The feedback from these respondents should provide guidance regarding service gaps and needs as the Department of Public Health and Social Services and its community partners collaboratively develop a strategic plan to better address diabetes prevention and control on Guam. The information should also serve to direct quality improvement efforts to enhance existing diabetes services on the island.
