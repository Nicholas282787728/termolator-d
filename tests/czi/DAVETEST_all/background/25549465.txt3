Molecular epidemiological analysis of the HIV infection in the Blagoveshchensk and Khabarovsk Area (Russian Far East)
The results of the molecular-epidemiological analysis of the HIV-1 variants circulating in Blagoveshchensk and Khabarovsk (Russian Far East) were presented. In Blagoveshchensk HIV-1 IDU-A variants were dominated (92.5%), similar to the regions of the European part of Russia. In Khabarovsk the heterogeneity of circulating HIV-1 variants was noted. In addition to IDU-A variants (66.0%), the strains of subtype B (12.6%), C (4.4%) and recombinant strain form CRF02_AG (17.0%) were identified. Using the phylogenetic analysis method the version of the penetration of HIV-1 variants from China and Japan was not supported.
