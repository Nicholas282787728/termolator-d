Effects of dioscorea modified pill on cognitive impairment of patients with VCIND: an preliminary study of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy
To explore the therapeutic effect evaluation of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) in patients with vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (VCIND) with dioscorea modified pill. A total of 100 patients with VCIND were randomly assigned into the dioscorea modified pill group (n = 50) and the aricept group (n = 50). And 50 healthy volunteers were recruited as normal group. Each patient was examined with (1)H-MRS and scored with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale pre- and post-treatment. After therapy, the NAA/Cr ratios and the itemized scores of cognitive scale compared with that of pre-therapy had significantly difference (P   0.05) in the dioscorea modified pill group (MMSE (26.5 ± 2.0), CDR(0.14 ± 0.23))vs(MMSE(25.1 ± 2.3), CDR(0.5)). But no difference existed in the aricept group (P > 0.05). (1)H-MRS may objectively reflect cognitive dysfunction in VCIND patients. And it has important values in the therapeutic effect evaluation of VCIND with dioscorea modified pill.
