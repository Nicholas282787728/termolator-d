Which benefits for the clinician to implement MALDI-TOF/MS in the bacteriology laboratory?
Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) is a recent technology especially adapted to identify microbial pathogens. It has rapidly established itself as a must for most medical bacteriology laboratories. Its ease of use and speed of execution typically permit providing pathogen identification one day earlier to the clinicians. MALDI-TOF/MS facilitates identification of filamentous fungi and mycobacteria that require particular lab expertise when using conventional methods. This paper highlights the multiple advantages that MALDI-TOF/MS can bring to the physicians in their practice.
