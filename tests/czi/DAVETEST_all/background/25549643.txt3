Effect of benazepril on cardiac function in Chinese patients with chronic heart failure: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of benazepril in Chinese patients with chronic systolic heart failure. We searched the databases of Cochrane, PubMed, EMbase, CBM and CNKI from January 1989 to November 2010 for the relevant studies. Two investigators identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) independently according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Statistical data analysis was performed with the Stata 11 software. A total of 15 studies with 1 355 Chinese patients of chronic systolic heart failure fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among them, 546 received benazepril monotherapy. The dose range of benazepril was 5 to 40 mg daily. And it was similar to angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in improving left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)(P = 0.674), reducing LVEDD (P = 0.511) and improving cardiac output (P = 0.363). The combination therapy of benazepril and ARB was superior to ARB monotherapy in reducing left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) (P = 0.001). However, LVEF was comparable between patients with ACEI/ARB combination therapy and those with ARB monotherapy (P = 0.105). Compared with blank control, benazepril treatment was associated with a significant improvement in LVEF from baseline to follow-up (WMD = 6.5%; 95% CI: 0.9%, 12.0%; P = 0.022). Compared with baseline, benazepril treatment significantly increased LVEF (WMD = 10.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI]:7.1%, 13.8%; P   0.001) and cardiac output (WMD = 1.5 L; CI:0.3, 2.6 L, P = 0.016). A significant reduction in LVEDD (WMD = 5.3 mm; CI: 2.7, 7.8 mm, P   0.001) was also observed in benazepril group. As the most common side effect after benazepril treatment, cough had a prevalence of 11.6%. Other side effects were rare. Benazepril is both efficacious and safe in the management of Chinese patients with chronic heart failure.
