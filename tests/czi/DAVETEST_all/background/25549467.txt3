Variants of the immunoreactivity and infectious process in bank vole (Myodes glareolus) experimentally infected with the hantavirus Puumala (PUUV)
As a result of a longitudinal study of the Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) in the experimentally infected bank voles (Myodes glareolus), we revealed three groups of the voles differing in the immunoreactivity and viral antigen concentration in the organs. The close correlation between these parameters suggested the existence of various mechanisms of the hantavirus persistence in the host.
