Pseudo-color filter in two-dimensional imaging in dentistry
Most digital systems that are currently used in two-dimensional imaging in dentistry provide opportunities for different image processing filters. One possible means of enhancing digital radiographic image is pseudocoloring (i.e., color conversion of gray-scale images). Recently, this method has become widely used in digital radiology. The human eye is more sensitive to differences in color than to differences in shades of gray. Theoretically, converting a gray scale intensity level of a digital image into colors could enhance the radiographic information. There have been some studies that applied pseudocoloring of digital radiographic images for the detection of caries and periodontal defects. However, thus far, this method failed to show a significantly improved ability for the detection of these lesions. Further investigations are necessary in order to develop specific algorithms that will increase the validity of pseudocoloring in two-dimensional imaging in dentistry.
