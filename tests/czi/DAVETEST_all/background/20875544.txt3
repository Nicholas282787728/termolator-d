Evaluation of hand hygiene guidelines and protocols used in Spain
The aim of this study was to evaluate, through a retrospective and external study, the quality of Spanish hand hygiene guidelines and protocols. None of the guidelines achieved a score of 100% in all areas. The mean score was only 43.9%, ranging from 23.8% for rigorous design to 69.4% for clarity and presentation. None of the protocols achieved a score of 100% in all areas; 100% clearly named the health problem dealt with in the protocol, which was reflected in its contents, and complied with length specifications and absence of formal defects; 80% had a paginated index and 66.7% a definition of compliance, while only 6.7% contained information on organization and functioning, the necessary resources, procedures and evaluation period. In general, the average compliance was less than 50%, except in one guideline, which met 87.5% of the requirements Problems with references were found in 77.7%. In view of the problems detected, a new guide for the drafting of hand hygiene guidelines and protocols is proposed.
