The role of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy(PEG)in palliative care
The role of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy(PEG)in palliative care has not been well discussed. With the evolution of endoscopic techniques and PEG devices, we can perform PEG more safely, even in difficult cases. Actually, PEG is very useful in home care of cancer patients. We should discuss the indications of PEG in the field of palliative medicine. We suggest the following indications for PEG: 1.Difficulty in ingestion of sufficient quantities of food and water because of pain on swallowing, or an obstruction caused by cancer. 2.Normal gastrointestinal function. 3.Expected survival time of more than four weeks in addition to absence of cachexia. 4.Patient's consent for PEG.
