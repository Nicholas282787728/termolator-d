Comparative lipidomic profiling of two Dunaliella tertiolecta strains with different growth temperatures under nitrate-deficient conditions
The metabolic changes that occur in Dunaliella tertiolecta upon exposure to low temperatures and nitrate deficiency were analyzed by exploring the fatty acid composition and lipid profile of two strains that were acclimated to different temperatures. The results indicate that the levels of linolenic acid (C18:3) and diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserine (DGTS) were significantly higher in the low-temperature (15 °C) strain (SCCAP K-0591) than in a strain grown at 21 °C (UTEX LB999). In addition, DGTS accumulated in LB999 under nitrate-deficient conditions, while the levels of most lipids, including DGTS, remained almost consistent in K-0591. The higher levels of DGTS in K-0591 suggest that DGTS could play a role in adaptation to low temperatures and nitrate deficiency in this organism. The results of this research could be applied to the development of new microalgal strains with tolerance of low temperature and nitrate deficiency by metabolic engineering targeted to DGTS species.
