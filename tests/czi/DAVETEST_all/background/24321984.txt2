Laboratory challenges conducting international clinical research in resource-limited settings
There are many challenges to performing clinical research in resource-limited settings. Here, we discuss several of the most common laboratory issues that must be addressed. These include issues relating to organization and personnel, laboratory facilities and equipment, standard operating procedures, external quality assurance, shipping, laboratory capacity, and data management. Although much progress has been made, innovative ways of addressing some of these issues are still very much needed.
