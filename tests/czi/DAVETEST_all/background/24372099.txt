Polymeric micelle assembly for the direct synthesis of platinum-decorated mesoporous TiO(2) toward highly selective sensing of acetaldehyde
Platinum-decorated mesoporous TiO2 is synthesized by the self-assembly of polymeric micelles of an asymmetric triblock copolymer with three chemically distinct units in an acidic tetrahydrofuran solution. The strong hydrophobic interaction of platinum(II) 2,4-pentanedionate with a polystyrene core and electrostatic interaction of titanium tetraisopropoxide with a poly(vinylpyridine) shell enable us to directly synthesize crystalline mesoporous TiO2 with platinum nanoparticles. A thermally stable block copolymer prevents collapse of the ordered mesostructure during the calcination process. The platinum source is in situ reduced to form the platinum nanoparticles on the TiO2 walls. The sensing performance of platinum-decorated mesoporous TiO2 is studied in detail using a quartz crystal microbalance technique, and it is found that it shows excellent sensitivity for acetaldehyde.
