Patient, tumor and therapeutic features related to recurrence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
To evaluate the correlations between patient, tumor and therapeutic features and DCIS recurrence after primary treatment, a cohort of 132 cases of DCISs, treated at Prof. Dr. Ion Chiricuta Oncology Institute, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, between 1999 and 2010, were studied. Present study showed that age  45 years at diagnosis and presence of the necrosis were significantly correlated with recurrence, meanwhile nuclear grade is significantly correlated with quicker relapse meaning that for high-grade lesions recurrence occurs usually during the first 36 months of follow-up, meanwhile for non-high-grade lesions recurrence usually occurs after 36 months of follow-up. Also, the study showed that a important factor correlated with recurrence (both local and overall) for patients treated with breast conservative surgery (BCS) was the status of the resection margins as well as the association of adjuvant radiotherapy. Overall recurrence rate was 9.(84)% and during a mean follow-up of 62.99 months with limits between 24 (imposed by study) and 153 months, standard deviation 29.28.
