Health economic evaluation of outpatient management of fibromyalgia patients and the costs avoided by diagnosing fibromyalgia in France
To assess whether the decrease in medical resource use and cost after diagnosing fibromyalgia, observed in a large primary care population in the United Kingdom can be extrapolated to France. A questionnaire was created based on medical resource use by 2,260 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia between 01/01/1998 and 31/03/2003 in the General Practice Research Database in the UK. Sixty French experts (general practitioners, rheumatologists) assessed whether the data from that database are in line with their clinical practice and, if not, were asked to provide data reflecting their own experience. The evaluation period went from 4 years before to 4 years after diagnosis using 1-year cross-sections. Evaluated resources were drug use, diagnostics tests, general practitioners and specialist visits, and also paramedical or alternative treatments. Data regarding inpatient care and productivity loss were not collected. Medical resource use if no diagnosis had been established was estimated, so the impact of diagnosis could be evaluated. Whereas costs gradually increase before diagnosis, stagnation in costs occurs in the year after diagnosis, followed by a moderate decrease afterwards. The same trend was observed whether the panel consisted of general practitioners or rheumatologists. The savings made as a result of fibromyalgia diagnosis add up to 126 euros per patient per year for the health care payer. General practitioner visits, diagnostic tests and drug use represent respectively 57%, 23% and 12% of the savings. Also in France, early diagnosis of fibromyalgia leads to a decrease in resource use and health care costs.
