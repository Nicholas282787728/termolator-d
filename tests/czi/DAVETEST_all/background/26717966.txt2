Protein-protein interactions among signaling pathways may become new therapeutic targets in liver cancer (Review)
Numerous signaling pathways have been shown to be dysregulated in liver cancer. In addition, some protein-protein interactions are prerequisite for the uncontrolled activation or inhibition of these signaling pathways. For instance, in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, protein AKT binds with a number of proteins such as mTOR, FOXO1 and MDM2 to play an oncogenic role in liver cancer. The aim of the present review was to focus on a series of important protein-protein interactions that can serve as potential therapeutic targets in liver cancer among certain important pro-carcinogenic signaling pathways. The strategies of how to investigate and analyze the protein-protein interactions are also included in this review. A survey of these protein interactions may provide alternative therapeutic targets in liver cancer.
