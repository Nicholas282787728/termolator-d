Deep brain stimulation for psychiatric disorders
Research on DBS for psychiatric disorders is being carried out in several areas, including obsessive- compulsive disorder, major depression, addictions, Tourette's syndrome and eating disorders. The results in the literature are described. The need for rigorous screening by interdisciplinary and ethical teams is explained. The need for pooling patients across different centres, with common treatment protocols, in order to achieve necessary large-scale studies in psychiatric DBS with long-term follow-up is pointed out.
