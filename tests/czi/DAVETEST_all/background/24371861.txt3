Peripheral nerve stimulation for treatment of chronic headache: a case report
Chronic daily headaches can be debilitating. Multiple treatments have been suggested with varying degrees of success. We present a case of a 27-year-old female with greater than ten years of chronic daily headaches. The patient was evaluated at the headache clinic where she was diagnosed with complex migraine with components of occipital neuralgia. Multiple medication regimens were tried without significant benefit. The patient also underwent bilateral occipital blocks along with trigger point injections of various muscles including the semispinalis capitis with significant but limited duration of benefit. After other treatments were unsuccessful, the patient was referred to the Pain Management Center and underwent a trial of peripheral nerve stimulation with significant pain relief without complications. She then proceeded with permanent implantation of the peripheral nerve stimulator with continued pain relief. This case demonstrates the utility of peripheral nerve stimulation for the treatment of refractory chronic daily headaches and should be part of our armamentarium.
