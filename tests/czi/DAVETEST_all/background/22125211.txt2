The oxidative stress in pathogenesis of arterial hypertension - role of methylated arginines
Oxidative stress plays significant role in pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases. Imbalance of antioxidants and reactive oxygen species contributes to endothelium damage and leads to hypertension. The knowledge on these processes may contribute to prevention and therapy of cardiovascular diseases. This paper describes the role of methylated arginines in pathogenesis of arterial hypertension, which are nowadays object of wide research and pathways involved in their formation and metabolism are often recognised as potential targets for cardiovascular drugs.
