The matrix metalloproteinase-7 and pro-enzyme of metalloproteinase-1 as a potential marker for patients with rectal cancer without distant metastasis
The aim of this study was the evaluation of clinical usage of metalloproteinase (MMP): proMMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 in serum of patients with rectal cancer, as well as the selection of parameters of the greatest diagnostic sensitivity and the determination of their relation with clinicopathological features, what is more, the demonstration whether their concentrations may have a prognostic value in the assessment of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The study comprised 100 patients with rectal cancer including 29 women and 71 men. The tested group was comprised of qualified patients without distant metastasis (M0). It was demonstrated that in patients with rectal cancer, the concentrations of MMP-9, MMP-7, and proMMP-1 as well as TIMP-1 were significantly higher in comparison to the reference group. On the basis of ROC curves, the greatest diagnostic sensitivity of MMP-9 was demonstrated. When evaluating the correlation of tested parameters with the size of the tumor (T1-T2 vs T3-T4), essential differences were shown for proMMP-1 concentrations. The highest percentage of patients with progression had an increased concentration of MMP-7 and TIMP-1. During a 5-year follow-up, univariate log-rank analysis had shown an essential dependence between the concentration of MMP-7 in men and DSF which was confirmed in Cox multivariate analysis. It was demonstrated that the pretreatment concentration of proMMP-1 may be clinically useful when evaluating the mass of the tumor, whereas MMP-7 may be a prognostic factor for DFS in men with rectal cancer without distant metastasis.
