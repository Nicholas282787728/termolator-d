Pharmacogenomics of taxane/platinum therapy in ovarian cancer
Taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) chemotherapy is commonly used in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Despite an initial high response to therapy, the 5-year survival rate remains low. The identification of pharmacogenomic markers to identify patients unlikely to respond or at risk for severe toxicity will assist in the goal of individualizing ovarian cancer treatment. Most studies have assessed single nucleotide polymorphisms from genes involved in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. Unfortunately, most markers identified have not been replicated in subsequent studies. Other mechanisms of variability, including epigenetic control of gene expression and copy number variation, may play important roles. In addition, nongenetic influences such as concurrent medications, and physiological and environmental factors could also affect individual responses to taxane and platinum therapy.
