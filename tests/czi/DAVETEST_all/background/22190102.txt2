Advancing public health through continuing education of health care professionals
This article describes how the CS2day (Cease Smoking Today) initiative positioned continuing education (CE) in the intersection between medicine and public health. The authors suggest that most CE activities address the medical challenges that clinicians confront, often to the neglect of the public health issues that are key risk factors for the onset and exacerbation of diseases. The authors further suggest that the educational activities of the CS2day initiative functioned as Type III translational science in that it facilitated the use of research-derived practice guidelines in clinical practice and in the community. The article concludes by stating that the successful results of the CS2day initiative illustrate what can happen when continuing education efforts develop from a public health problem rather than just a practice gap identified in a clinical practice setting.
