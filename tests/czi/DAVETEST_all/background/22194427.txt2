International perspective on the diagnosis of death
There is growing medical consensus in a unifying concept of human death. All human death involves the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, combined with the irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. Death then is a result of the irreversible loss of these functions in the brain. This paper outlines three sets of criteria to diagnose human death. Each set of criteria clearly establishes the irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, combined with the irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe. The most appropriate set of criteria to use is determined by the circumstances in which the medical practitioner is called upon to diagnose death. The three criteria sets are somatic (features visible on external inspection of the corpse), circulatory (after cardiorespiratory arrest), and neurological (in patients in coma on mechanical ventilation); and represent a diagnostic standard in which the medical profession and the public can have complete confidence. This review unites authors from Australia, Canada, and the UK and examines the medical criteria that we should use in 2012 to diagnose human death.
