Perceptions of QOL among caregivers of Mexican ancestry of adults with advanced cancer
There is a substantial gap in the literature about the perceptions of QOL of caregivers of Mexican ancestry. This qualitative study explores the role of culture on the perceptions of QOL of this understudied population. Twenty caregivers providing care to adults with advanced cancer were interviewed. Thematic analysis identified several themes for each domain of QOL, including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains and the role of culture. Cultural background influenced all of the QOL domains. There was a tremendous synergy across domains of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. Extended family and religious beliefs, life experiences, and culture were important components of QOL for these caregivers. Cultural expectations influenced role functioning and caregiver burden. This study informs our understanding of the role of culture on perceptions of QOL. Future investigations should be conducted with other Latino subgroups to describe QOL and to determine the role of culture on perceived QOL. Interventions should be specifically designed to improve caregivers' QOL and to reduce the burden of cancer in this underserved population.
