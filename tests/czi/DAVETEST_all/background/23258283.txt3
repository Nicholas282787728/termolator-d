The effect of motivational interviews on young drinkers' autonomous motivation
Assessing changes in autonomous and controlled motivation in a group of young at risk consumers and excessive alcohol consumers receiving motivational interviewing-based (MI) Intervention. MI-based group intervention was put into practice to observe its effects on types of motivation. Two groups were formed (an experimental and a control group) using pretest-posttest design. 63 adolescents participated: 31 formed the experimental group (80 % male) and 32 the control group (68 % male). The treatment self-regulation questionnaire (TSRQ) was used to evaluate autonomous and controlled motivation. Analysis of variance revealed that autonomous motivation scores had no statistically significant change after the brief intervention, whereas this was so with controlled motivation (p .05), suggesting that brief intervention had promoted this type of regulation towards moderate consumption expressed in terms of an external control, such as gaining social approval. The above results suggested that MI is a promising technique for intervention with Colombian adolescents as it had measurable positive effects on both types of motivation and motivational orientation toward control probably mediated the results. Individual motivational orientation and gender should be considered in the future.
