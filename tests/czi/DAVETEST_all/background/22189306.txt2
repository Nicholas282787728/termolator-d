A case of an end-of-life cancer patient in which lymphedema care improved the QOL enabling home hospice care
Recently, the importance of prevention and care of lymphedema has been recognized. It appears that the complex physical therapy is relatively taboo for an end-of-life cancer patient with lymphedema. Therefore, an intervention of care is often difficult. In our case, the patient strongly desired a hospice care at home, so we introduced a home hospice care gradually taking a step by step approach with anticipated harmful symptoms. As a result, the home hospice care was doable with ADL and QOL improvements. For lymphedema care of an end-of-life cancer patient, a goal setting, sharing the patient's will based on anticipated symptoms, and an introduction of a gradual care were all important.
