Safety and acceptability of intrauterine balloon stent used in uterine after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis to prevent adhesion reformation
To evaluate the safety and acceptability of COOK intrauterine balloon stent in uterine for one week after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. A total of 79 females with moderate-severe Asherman syndrome undergoing hysteroscopic division of intrauterine adhesion were enrolled from June 2012 to December 2013. They were divided into two groups of intrauterine balloon stent (n = 51) and tailed intrauterine contraceptive device (n = 28). The sterile swabs were taken from cervical canals for bacterial culture by the same microbiologist. Each patient in balloon group was requested to answer a questionnaire survey on the acceptability of balloon stent. 82.3% of them could tolerate discomforts during balloon placement and 86.3% desired re-ballooning if necessary. Positive microorganism cultures were seen in 17 patients (33.3%) in balloon group versus 8 (28.6%) in intrauterine contraceptive device group. And the positive rate was not different between two groups. It is relatively safe to maintain the intrauterine balloon stent in uterine for one week. And most patients accept readily the intrauterine balloon stent.
