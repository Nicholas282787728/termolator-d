Comparative characteristics of using isoflurane, sevoflurane and target concentration of propofol during reconstructive operations on the carotid arteries
To compare effects of isoflurane, sevoflurane and target concentration of propofol on the systemic hemodynamics, cerebral blood flow and cerebral oximetry of the brain during the carotid endarterectomy. We studied 95 patients. The patients were divided into 3 groups. Group I included 26 patients who received isoflurane (under I MAC), Group II--40 patients who received sevoflurane (under I MAC), Group III--29 patients who received target concentration of propofol (under 4 mkg/ml) according to the method of Schneider Studied parameters were defined at the stages: before the operation (I), after the induction (II), after the intubation (III), during the separation of the carotid artery (IV), after the crossclamping of the carotid artery (V), before starting the bloodstream (VI), after starting of the bloodstream (VII), after the end of the operation (VIII). At the first stages of the operation, the using of isoflurane, sevoflurane and propofol was accompanied with moderate dose-dependent lowering of indicators ofcirculatory dynamics. The linear blood flow velocity (LBFV) in the middle cerebral artery on the affected side in the groups of isoflurane and propofol did not depend on the indicators ofcirculatory dynamics; in the sevoflurane group the correlation was traced During the breakoff of the blood circulation in the reconstructed carotid arteries while using the anesthesia of isoflurane, sevoflurane and propofol hemodynamics was stable. LBFV and cerebral oximetry (CO) in the groups of isoflurane and propofol did not depend on the systemic hemodynamics; in the sevoflurane group--they depended After the reinitiating of the bloodstream in the conditions of the isoflurane andpropofol anesthesia the reperfusion of the brain was moderate; in the conditions of the sevoflurane anesthesia the risk of reperfusion damage of the brain during the uncontrolled hypertension remained. At the stage of finishing the operation LBFV and CO did not depend on the systemic hemodynamics in the isoflurane and propofol groups, in the sevoflurane group the dependence was indicated. Consequently, at all the stages of the operation we indicated the disorder of the mechanisms of the brain blood supply autoregulation in the sevoflurane group.
