A novel vortex-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction approach using auxiliary solvent: Determination of iodide in mineral water samples
A novel vortex-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-LLME) for determination of iodide was developed. The method includes the oxidation of iodide with iodate in the presence of hydrochloric acid followed by VA-LLME of the ion-pair formed between ICl2(-) and Astra Phloxine reagent (AP) and subsequent absorbance measurement at 555nm. The appropriate experimental conditions were investigated and found to be: 5mL of sample, 0.27molL(-)(1) HCl, 0.027mmolL(-1) KIO3 as the oxidation agent, 250μL of extraction mixture containing amyl acetate as the extraction solvent and carbon tetrachloride as the auxiliary solvent (1:1, v/v), 0.04mmolL(-1) AP reagent, vortex time: 20s at 3000rpm, centrifugation: 4min at 3000rpm. The calibration plot was linear in the range 16.9-169μg L(-1) of iodide, with a correlation coefficient (R(2)) of 0.996, and the relative standard deviation ranged from 1.9 to 5.7%. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 1.75 and 6.01μgL(-)(1) of iodide, respectively. The suggested procedure was applied for determination of iodide in real mineral water samples.
