Retrospective study of clinical features of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease with connective tissue disease
To explore the clinical features of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disease (NMOSD) with connective tissue disease (CTD). The clinical features of 184 NMO/NMOSD patients (NMO/NMOSD: 119/184, 64.7%; NMO/NMOSD-CTD: 65/184, 35.3%) from May 2013 to May 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. And the effectiveness of long-term treatment of immunosuppressive drugs in NMOSD was evaluated. NMO/NMOSD-CTD patients had significantly higher female percentage (93.8% vs 83.2%, P   0.05) and significantly higher percentage of patients with cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)-restricted oligoclonal band (OB)(41.5% vs 21.9%, P   0.05). As compared with NMO/NMOSD-CTD counterparts, NMO/NMOSD patients had significantly higher percentage of non-specific lesions on brain MRI (62.5% vs 35.9%, P   0.01). After >6 months consecutive long-term treatment of immunosuppressive drugs, the relapse rate post-treatment (0.36 ± 0.85) was significantly lower than that pre-treatment (2.91 ± 4.10, P   0.01). And no significant difference existed in expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score between pre-and post-treatment. When using azathioprine (AZA), the percentage of relapse was significantly higher in NMO/NMOSD-CTD patients (50.0%) versus NMO/NMOSD ones (18.5%, P = 0.064); When using cyclophosphamide (CTX), there was no such significant difference. Female patients are more susceptible to have NMO/NMOSD with CTD. NMO/NMOSD-CTD patients tend to have higher percentage of CSF-restricted OB and fewer non-specific lesions on brain MRI. AZA and CTX may effectively reduce relapses in both NMO/NMOSD and NMO/NMOSD-CTD patients. However CTX is superior to AZA for reducing relapses in NMO/NMOSD-CTD patients.
