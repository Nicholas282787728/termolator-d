Duloxetine in major depressed patients resistant to SSRIs and/or venlafaxine
Several acute depression trials suggest that only 35% of the patients achieve remission state with antidepressant monotherapy. An increasing body of evidence is emerging suggesting that multi-action antidepressants might be more effective in treatment-resistant depressed patients than single-action agents. In this context, the purpose of the study was to assess the effectiveness of duloxetine in treatment-resistant major depressed outpatients. We performed a retrospective study assessing the efficacy of duloxetine in major depressed outpatients who did not achieve full symptom remission (CGI-S (severity) >=3) after treatment of adequate dose and duration (more than 8 weeks) with at least either one SSRI or the SNRI venlafaxine. We excluded patients with a severe medical illness and a personality disorder. CGI-S was used as a measure of symptom severity and administered before the prescription of duloxetine and 6 weeks later. The sample included 29 patients (9 M, 20 F). We observed a very significant decrease in CGI-S scores (4.86 ± 0.51 to 2.17 ± 1.44, p<0.0001) after treatment with duloxetine (dose between 60 and 120 mg). Remission was achieved in 48% of the patients. The tolerance was excellent. This study suggests the potential interest of duloxetine in some treatment-resistant depressed patients.
