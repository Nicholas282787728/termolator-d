Adverse reactions to injectable fillers
The number of fillers grows constantly and allows responding to an ever larger demand with mostly hyaluronic acid or collagen based products. However, products degrading more slowly, containing polylactic acid or bioactive ceramics. All these products bring in general satisfactory results. Their short term tolerance shows few side effects, benign and always reversible. Long term, foreign body granulomas are very rare if interrogation prior to patient's treatment is exhaustive. On the reverse, non degradable products are at the origin of unaesthetic and invalidating granulomas, often very delayed and resisting to various local treatments. For this reason, these products should not be used anymore or only very exceptionally, for soft tissue augmentation.
