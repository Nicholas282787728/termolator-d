Examination of integrated consultation support system that enabled the senior citizen's continuous home recuperation
We held a case study for an integrated consultation support system that enabled the senior citizen's continuous home recuperation. We had two purposes: One was to clarify a problem and then solve the problem for the senior citizens to continue a home recuperation. An effective support method was suggested. The other was to consider an ideal way to assign nursing staffs. Through the case study and its analysis,the effective support system should have these six points: (1) Construct a mutual trust with senior citizens,(2) Help them to improve a self-management ability of daily life,(3) Improve the family and relative's nursing capabilities which enable the senior citizens to live at home,(4) Advise to the neighbors who support the senior citizens,(5) Align a support schedule for the neighbors and relatives who may live far away,(6) Support the senior citizens to have their own roles,and lead them a life worth living. The Nursing staff roles are as follows: (1) Support the senior citizens who are ready to leave the hospital for home recuperation with a consistent policy,(2) Examine the case with a best use of three occupational specialties,(3) Try to make a community where the senior citizens' hope will be enabled.
