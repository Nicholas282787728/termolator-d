H(3)PW(12)O(40)-catalyzed multicomponent reaction for efficient synthesis of highly substituted piperidines
A simple, diastereoselective, inexpensive, and efficient route for the synthesis of highly functionalized piperidines by the condensation of Î²-keto-esters, aromatic aldehydes and anilines using H3PW12O40 as a catalyst is described. The catalyst could be easily recovered after completion of the reaction and reused without a considerable change in its activity. Furthermore, in most cases the piperidine precipitates out of solution.
