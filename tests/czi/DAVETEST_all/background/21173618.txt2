Update on prognostic genetic testing in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS)
Case-control genome-wide association studies using a large, geographically diverse data base has been used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms that have prognostic utility in predicting progression of mild adolescent idiopathic scoliosis in White patients. The calculated risk of progression score allows stratification of patients that can make medical care evidence based, less costly, and more efficient.
