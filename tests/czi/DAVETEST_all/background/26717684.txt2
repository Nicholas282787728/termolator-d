Physiological Effect of Vallisneria natans Under Different Concentrations of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Chloramphenicol
The effects of peroxidase(POD), superoxide dismutase(SOD) activities and malondialdehyde(MDA), soluble proteins and chlorophyll in the leaves of Vallisneria natans exposed to different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the eutrophication water body and chloramphenicol after 7 days were investigated in the study. The soluble protein content increased significantly in group eutrophic water and 0.2 µg.L-1 chloramphenicol, and the concentration of protein was 2.38 times of that in group 0 µg.L-1 chloramphenicol. In group of eutrophic water and 0. 2 µg.L-1 chloramphenicol, POD activities decreased significantly to 33. 84% of that in group 0 µg.L-1 chloramphenicol. With the increasing of the joint concentration, SOD activities decreased. SOD activities in group of mesotrophic and 0. 2 µg.L-1 chloramphenicol was 28. 59% of that in group of 0 µg.L-1 chloramphenicol.
