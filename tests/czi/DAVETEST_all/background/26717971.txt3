Osteochondral Allograft Transplantation of the Femoral Trochlea
Osteochondral allograft (OCA) transplantation is a recognized treatment modality for cartilage damage in the knee. Few reports are available on outcomes of OCA in the patellofemoral joint, and there are no reports on lesions isolated to the femoral trochlea. To evaluate graft survivorship and clinical outcomes in patients who had an OCA to the femoral trochlea. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. An OCA database was used to identify 29 knees in 28 patients (mean age, 30.2 years; range, 12-47 years; 8 female, 20 male) who were treated with a fresh OCA transplant limited to the femoral trochlea. The primary outcome was graft survivorship, and the minimum follow-up was 2 years. Clinical outcomes were assessed by the modified Merle d'Aubigné-Postel (18-point) score; Knee Society function (KS-F) score; International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) pain, function, and total scores; and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) activity score. The OCA patient satisfaction score (5-point scale from extremely satisfied to dissatisfied) was also reported. The mean follow-up period was 7.0 years (range, 2.1-19.9 years). Graft survivorship was 100% at 5 years and 91.7% at 10 years. One patient was converted to a total knee arthroplasty 7.6 years after OCA surgery. The mean modified Merle d'Aubigné-Postel score improved from 13.0 to 16.1, the mean KS-F score from 65.6 to 85.2, and the mean IKDC total score from 38.5 to 71.9; the mean UCLA score was 7.9 postoperatively. Eighty-nine percent of patients were extremely satisfied or satisfied with the outcome of surgery. Fresh OCA transplantation resulted in excellent clinical outcomes in this patient cohort with articular cartilage damage to the femoral trochlea. The procedure resulted in improved pain and function and high patient satisfaction.
