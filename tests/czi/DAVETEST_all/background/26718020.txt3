YouTube as a source of information on mouth (oral) cancer
We examined the content of YouTube (™) videos on mouth (oral) cancer, and evaluated their usefulness in promoting early detection of oral cancer. A systematic search of YouTube (™) for videos containing information on mouth cancer was conducted using the keywords 'mouth cancer' and 'oral cancer'. Demographics of videos, including type, source, length, and viewers' interaction, were evaluated, and three researchers independently assessed the videos for usefulness in promoting early detection of oral cancer. A total of 188 You Tube (™) videos (152 patient- oriented educational videos and 36testimonial videos) were analyzed. The overall usefulness score ranged from 0 to 10 (mean=3.56 ±2.44). The most useful videos ranked late on the viewing list, and there was no significant correlation between video usefulness and viewing rate, viewers' interaction, and video length. Videos uploaded by individual users were less useful compared to videos uploaded by professional organizations or by health care professionals. ealth care professionals, academic institutions and professional organizations have a responsibility for improving the content of YouTube (™) about mouth cancer by uploading useful videos, and directing patients to reliable information sources.
