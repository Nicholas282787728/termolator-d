Diagnostic approach of intracellular bacteria and fastidious microorganisms
Obligate or facultative intracellular bacteria are fastidious organisms that do not or poorly grow on conventional culture media. Some of them may be the cause of frequent and potentially severe infections, such as tuberculosis (Myco- bacterium tuberculosis), community-acquired respiratory infections (Legionella spp., Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae) or blood culture-negative endocarditis (Coxiella burnetii, Bartonella spp., Tropheryma whipplei). The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive summary of the available and recommended diagnostic tests for the detection of these fastidious organisms in clinical practice.
