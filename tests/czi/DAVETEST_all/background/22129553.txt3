The cardiac intensive care unit perspective on hemodynamic monitoring of oxygen transport balance
The purpose of this consensus statement is to present the available evidence supporting the use of a variety of hemodynamic monitors in a pediatric population. Each article within this supplement and the presentations at the Eighth International Conference of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society provide the evidence to support recommendations for the use of each monitoring modality. The purpose of this editorial is to interpret the evidence provided elsewhere in this supplement from the perspective of cardiac critical care.
