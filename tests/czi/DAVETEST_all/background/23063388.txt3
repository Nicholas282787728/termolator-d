Effect of guided bone regeneration with or without pericardium bioabsorbable membrane on bone formation
The purpose of this study was to evaluate bone formation after using allogeneic bone alone or with a membrane. Bone graft was performed using the allograft Tutoplast, mineralized cancellous bone allograft, and pericardium in calvarial defects of 60 rats. Rats were divided in 3 groups: control group (no bone graft), group 1 (bone graft without membrane), and group 2 (bone graft with membrane). The most new bone formation occurred in group 2. After 6 weeks, group 2 showed infiltration of inflammatory cells, and inflammatory cells were still observed after 12 weeks. The membrane remained even after 12 weeks, and the membrane facilitated bone regeneration by blocking connective tissue. The membrane facilitated new bone formation by inhibiting connective tissue invasion.
