Evidence-based and promising interventions to prevent alcohol useÂ among youth: a literature review
Although the annual average consumption of pure alcohol in France has decreased since the early sixties, some indicators of alcohol consumption among young people have increased over the past decade. This paper reviews the current knowledge of interventions aimed at preventing alcohol use among children and adolescents. The study used a standard protocol to identify and review the literature and to classify the selected interventions. Twenty-seven interventions were found to have an effect on youth alcohol consumption, including 6 aimed at children under 10 years of age, 9 aimed at young people aged 10-15 years, and 8 aimed at young people over 16 years. A further 4 interventions were designed to tackle the issue of alcohol supply. Most of the interventions (17) target the general population. The study also found that many interventions aimed at children or adolescents involve parent participation. This review demonstrates the complementarity of interventions targeting individuals and those aimed at tackling alcohol supply. It also highlights potential synergies through interventions with an impact on youth alcohol consumption but also on other substance uses and on mental health.
