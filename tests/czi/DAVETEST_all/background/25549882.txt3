Predictors of ventricular fibrillation at reperfusion in patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention
Ventricular fibrillation (VF) during reperfusion (rVF) in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is an infrequent but serious event that complicates coronary interventions. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical predictors of rVF in an unselected population of patients with STEMI treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Consecutive patients with STEMI admitted to a tertiary care hospital for primary PCI from 2007 to 2012 were retrospectively assessed for the presence of rVF. Admission electrocardiograms, stored in a digital format, were analyzed for a maximal ST-segment elevation in a single lead and the sum of ST-segment deviations in all leads. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and angiographic characteristics were tested for associations with rVF using logistic regression analysis. Among 3,724 patients with STEMI admitted from 2007 to 2012, 71 (1.9%) had rVF. In univariate analysis, history of myocardial infarction, aspirin and β-blocker use, VF before PCI, left main coronary artery disease, inferior myocardial infarction localization, symptom-to-balloon time  360 minutes, maximal ST-segment elevation in a single lead >300 μV, and sum of ST-segment deviations in all leads >1,500 μV were associated with increased risk for rVF. In a multivariate analysis, sum of ST-segment deviations in all leads >1500 μV (odds ratio 3.7, 95% confidence interval 1.45 to 9.41, p = 0.006) before PCI remained an independent predictor of rVF. In-hospital mortality was 18.3% in the rVF group and 3.3% in the group without VF (p  0.001), but rVF was not an independent predictor of in-hospital death. In conclusion, the magnitude of ST-segment elevation before PCI for STEMI independently predicts rVF and should be considered in periprocedural arrhythmic risk assessment. Despite higher in-hospital mortality in patients with rVF, rVF itself has no independent prognostic value for prognosis.
