The anxiety and types of problems encountered by homecare patients during an intermittent self-catheterization
The aim of this study was to clarify why a homecare patient had an anxiety and the type of difficulties while having an intermittent self-catheterization at home. We used a questionnaire survey to conduct an oral interview for 25 homecare patients, who regularly had an intermittent self-catheterization. The survey results were codified into single phrase units of meaning, and then separated into categories. The results revealed that 70 to 80% of patients who had an intermittent self catheterization in their own homes experienced an anxiety and encountered difficulties during the process. The findings emphasized the importance of providing a sort of support for homecare patients when they have an intermittent self-catheterization for the first time, as well as the importance of providing continued support until the patients are comfortable with the procedure. For a future support, these patients' anxiety need to be reduced and difficulties related to an intermittent self catheterization resolved during an outpatient visit.
