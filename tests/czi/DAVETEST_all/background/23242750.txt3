Haemostatic resuscitation
Recommendations for resuscitation of patients in early haemorrhagic shock, with active ongoing bleeding, have evolved in recent years. This review covers current theories of the pathophysiology of shock and recommended treatments, including damage control surgery, deliberate hypotensive management, administration of antifibrinolytics, early support of the coagulation system, and the possible role of deep anaesthesia. Future directions for resuscitation research are discussed.
