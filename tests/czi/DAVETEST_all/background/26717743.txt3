Preparation of Rubber Accelerator Tetramethyl Thiuram Monosulfide and Its Spectral Analysis
In the study, rubber accelerator tetramethyl thiuram monosulfide (TMTM) was synthesized firstly. Single crystal TMTM was cultivated by solvent evaporation method. TMTM was detected and characterized by XRD single crystal diffraction, FTIR, TG-DSC. The micro-structure and intrinsic regularity were revealed. The TMTM microstructure was revealed by XRD single crystal diffraction from the diffraction data, part of bond length and bond angle. Its highly efficient performance of rubber vulcanization promotion was decided due to its orientation structure and high order. Properties of TMTM was disclosed by TG-DSC analysis from the heat effect. The results of TG-DSC and FTIR showed that single crystal TMTM possessed with little CS2. The chemical bond types in TMTM were revealed by FTIR the same as single crystal diffraction testing by different way. The decomposition temperature of TMTM was very high. It could provided reference with research on rubber vulcanizing properties by TMTM on rubber vulcanizing machine. This study can help the enterprises to designate the working standard tracing detection of TMTM industrialized production. Performance index of TMTM was judged. The project of TMTM industry standard can be declared by the enterprises, written a draft standard. It can provide the basis experimental data on completing the revision of the national ministry of industry and information technology standard system project plan.
