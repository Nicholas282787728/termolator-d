Determination of Ginsenosides Amount and Geographical Origins of Ginseng by NIR Spectroscopy
In the study, 74 samples of ginseng were harvested from three provinces located in the northeast of China. Method for the quantification of total amount of ginsenosides Rg1, Rb1, and Re in samples with near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was developed with the application of partial least squares regression (PLSR). The reference analysis was performed using a UPLC method. Different pretreatments like multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), Norris-Derivative were applied on the spectra to optimize the calibration and the spectral regions from 6001 to 4007 cm(-1) and from 10,000 to 8786 cm(-1) were selected for the calculation of the PLSR model. The root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) and root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) were 0.115 and 0.167, respectively, and the correlation coefficients were 0.9477 and 0.9153, respectively. At the same time, the spectral region from 8531 to 7559 cm(-1) was chosen to establish a model for identification the geographical origins of ginseng samples. MSC and Savitzky-Golay smoothing were utilized on the spectral preprocessing. According to the result, 74 samples were separated into three clusters, corresponding to the three geographical origins, i.e., Jilin, Liaoning and Heilongjiang Province. The cross-validation ability and the prediction ability were 96% and 90%, respectively. In Chinese Pharmacopeia, the total amount of ginsenosides Rg1, Rb1, and Re is used as one of the indexes to evaluate the quality of ginseng, the established quantification method herein is rapid and accurate, it can be applied as an alternative method for quality control of ginseng sample.
