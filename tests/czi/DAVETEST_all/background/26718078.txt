A critical review of the growth, drainage and collapse of foams
This review focuses on the current knowledge regarding (i) the mechanisms governing foamability and foam stability, and (ii) models for the foam column kinetics. Although different length scales of foam structure, such as air-water interface and liquid film, have been studied to elucidate the mechanisms that control the foamability and foam stability, many questions remain unanswered. It is due to the collective effects of different mechanisms involved and the complicated structures of foam sub-structures such as foam films, Plateau borders and nodes, and foam networks like soft porous materials. The current knowledge of the effects of solid particles on liquid film stability and foam drainage is also discussed to highlight gaps in our present level of understanding foam systems with solid particles. We also critically review and summarize the models that describe macroscopic foam behaviors, such as equilibrium foam height, foam growth and collapse, within the context of the mechanisms involved.
