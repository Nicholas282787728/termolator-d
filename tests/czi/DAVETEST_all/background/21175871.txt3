Impact of Avène hydrotherapy on the quality of life of atopic and psoriatic patients
Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis engender a significant deterioration in patients' quality of life. Although the efficacy of patient management at the Avène hydrotherapy centre has been demonstrated by clinical studies, few data relating to changes in the quality of life following therapeutic management are available. The objective of this study was to evaluate the short- and medium-term effects of hydrotherapy not only on the patients' quality of life, but also on the quality of life of the parents of the treated children. In this 6-month longitudinal observational study, adult (n = 174) and paediatric (n = 212) atopic patients and psoriatic patients (n = 262) had to complete questionnaires relating to the quality of life at the beginning (D0) and after 3 weeks hydrotherapy (W3), and then, 3 (M3) and 6 months (M6) later. The dermatology life quality index (DLQI) and the Short-Form-12 Health Survey (SF-12) generic questionnaire were given to adult patients. The children's dermatological life quality index (CDLQI) was given to paediatric patients, and the SF-12 to their parents. At D0, the DLQI score was 29.7 ± 20.1 and 26.9 ± 18.9 for atopic and psoriatic patients, respectively. At W3, this score had decreased significantly to reach 16.8 ± 14.9 (P   0.01) and 10.0 ± 10.5 (P   0.001) for atopic and psoriatic patients, respectively. The DLQI scores at M3 and M6 were 20.7 ± 16.4 and 23.1 ± 18.8 for atopic patients and 18.8 ± 16.7 and 21.9 ± 19.6 for psoriatic patients and remained significantly lower in comparison with D0 values (P   0.05). A 3-week course of treatment at the Avène hydrotherapy centre significantly improved the quality of life of patients suffering from skin diseases. This improvement persisted 3 and 6 months after management by hydrotherapy.
