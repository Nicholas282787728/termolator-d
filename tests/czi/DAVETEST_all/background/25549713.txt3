Opinion piece: Regulation of nursing assistants: A critical international issue?
Abstract Health care or nursing assistants are valuable members of health care teams who undertake a wide range of tasks, contribute to meeting the increasingly complex healthcare needs of patients and have various levels of training. However, they are not subject to regulation in many countries. If training and regulation are pre-requisites for ensuring the standards of care delivered by registered nurses, then this must also apply to nursing assistants. Regulation ensures the need for on-going education and development which is critical to maintaining and refreshing the values underpinning compassionate care for both nursing assistants and registered nurses.
