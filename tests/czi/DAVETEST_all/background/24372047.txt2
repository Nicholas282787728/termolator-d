S-Michael additions to chiral dehydroalanines as an entry to glycosylated cysteines and a sulfa-Tn antigen mimic
Stereoselective sulfa-Michael addition of appropriately protected thiocarbohydrates to chiral dehydroalanines has been developed as a key step in the synthesis of biologically important cysteine derivatives, such as S-(β-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-cysteine, which has not been synthesized to date, and S-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-D-galactopyranosyl)-L-cysteine, which could be considered as a mimic of Tn antigen. The corresponding diamide derivative was also synthesized and analyzed from a conformational viewpoint, and its bound state with a lectin was studied.
