Management and outcome of condylar fractures in children and adolescents: a review of the literature
The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive review of all kinds of case reports and clinical studies focusing on management and outcome of mandibular condylar fractures (CFs) in children and adolescents. A PubMed search of the international literature was done, completed by an additional hand search based on the available references of the publications found. In total, 73 articles were included in this review: 7 case reports and 2 retrospective clinical studies regarding surgical management, 1 publication with case reports, 1 prospective and 3 retrospective clinical studies comparing operative and conservative treatment, 20 publications with case reports, and 35 retrospective and 4 prospective clinical studies dealing with conservative management of CFs in children and adolescents. Despite frequently encountered radiologic abnormalities, conservative management of CFs in children usually yields satisfactory to excellent clinical results. However, in adolescents the outcome is often reported to be less favorable. Good prospective randomized multicenter studies would clarify from which age on patients could probably benefit from operative treatment.
