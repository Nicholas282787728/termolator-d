What is behind a wound?- case report
Chronic wound is a wound that does not heal in four to eight weeks. The most important predisposing factors are tissue ischemia and infection. In approximately 80% of cases, chronic wounds of lower limbs are the final form of chronic venous insufficiency. We report a case of chronic wound of lower limb that was treated as a posttraumatic war wound. After proper treatment of chronic venous wound of lower limb, it healed after almost 20 years. When chronic wound of lower limb is present, all diagnostic criteria should first exclude chronic venous insufficiency, and then proper treatment should be introduced.
