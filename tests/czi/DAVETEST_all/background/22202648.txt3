What's new in dermatological therapy?
Several good-quality randomised trials brought useful information on how to manage severe skin infections and develop anti-staphylococcus strategies. Trials on common warts did not bring any valuable solution. Rituximab and omalizumab have seen their indications becoming more precise or broadened. Meta-analyses have been particularly numerous, but most of the time with no decisive conclusion, since this methodology presents strong limitations for studying safety data. Most important work has been rather directed toward analysing safety data rather than efficacy. Among the most important results, are those from a retrospective cohort of patients taking isotretinoin: suicidal risk has to be linked to severe acne itself, rather than to the drug.
