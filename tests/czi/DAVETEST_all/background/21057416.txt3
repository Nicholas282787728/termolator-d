Does it exist?: a psychopathology of deafness
This work aims to study the relationship between psychopathology and deafness. These results show that the most frequent diagnosis among the deaf are disorders of mood and post-traumatic syndrome. Psychotic disorders and mental retardation, once widely diagnosed among deaf populations, are less frequent. The accuracy of these findings results from studies conducted by a team that is specialized in the care of the deaf and that also masters the socio-linguistic aspects of the deaf culture. The high prevalence of erroneous diagnosis posed by non-specialist teams in support of deaf persons, shows the need for the establishment of a bio-psycho-socio-specific language for the deaf.
