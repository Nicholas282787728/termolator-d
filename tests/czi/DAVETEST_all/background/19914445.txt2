Cystic Fibrosis Foundation evidence-based guidelines for management of infants with cystic fibrosis
Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) offers the opportunity for early medical and nutritional intervention that can lead to improved outcomes. Management of the asymptomatic infant diagnosed with CF through newborn screening, prenatal diagnosis, or sibling screening is different from treatment of the symptomatically diagnosed individual. The focus of management is on maintaining health by preventing nutritional and respiratory complications. The CF Foundation convened a committee to develop recommendations based on a systematic review of the evidence and expert opinion. These guidelines encompass monitoring and treatment recommendations for infants diagnosed with CF and are intended to help guide families, primary care providers, and specialty care centers in the care of infants with CF.
