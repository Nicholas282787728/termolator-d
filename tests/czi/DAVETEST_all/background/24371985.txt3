Effect of compression therapy in the management of venous ulcer - practical experience
Venous insufficiency is one of the most common causes of chronic wounds. Venous ulcers account for about 75% of all leg ulcers, and 50% of venous leg ulcers require long-term treatment lasting for more than 1 year. The most common location of venous ulcers is the lower third of the leg, as it is the site of strongest venous pressure; less often there are multiple venous ulcers that tend to be localized on both lower legs. In addition to the negative impact on the quality of life, such as immobility, pain and social isolation, which significantly affect the course and length of treatment, we cannot ignore the high costs of long-term and often uncertain treatment, which poses a major health, social and economic problem in the world and in our country.
