Spectral Analysis about the Pharmaceutical Cocrystal Formation of Piracetam and 3-Hydroxybenzoic Acid
Pharmaceutical cocrystal can improve physical and chemical properties of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), meanwhile this feature has shown great potential in improving the pharmaceutical's properties and characteristics. In this study, cocrystal formation between piracetam and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3HBA) using grinding method has been characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman and terahertz (THz) spectroscopical techniques. The vibrational modes of different motions are obtained by the assignment of the peaks in the spectra of the starting materials and the cocrystal components. FTIR, Raman and THz spectroscopical results show that the vibrational modes of the cocrystal are different from those of the starting materials. In addition, the dynamic process of the above cocrystal formation is investigated in-depth with Raman and THz spec- tra. Piracetam-3HBA cocrystal is formed pretty fast in first several minutes, and then the formation rate becomes slow. After 35 minutes, such formation process has been completed. The results offer the theoretical benchmark and unique means for real-time monitoring pharmaceutical cocrystal formation and also the corresponding quantitative analysis in the pharmaceutical field.
