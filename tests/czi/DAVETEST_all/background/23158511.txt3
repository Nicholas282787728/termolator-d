Communication in NICUs
In a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) counseling should be a shared culture for all the care givers: it should be developed by all the professionals, to face up to parents' needs of information, explanations, facility of decisions, finding of resources, agreement, help, reassurance, attention. The first essential aspect is the training in counseling skills, by periodic courses for all professionals of the department (physicians, nurses, and physiotherapists). In our department, a professional counselor is present, assisting the medical staff in direct counseling. The counselor's intervention allows a better parent orientation in the situation. A more effective sharing of these rules also facilitates the communication among parents and medical staff. Periodic meetings are established among the medical staff, in which the professional counselor discusses difficult situations to share possible communicative strategies. We wanted to have not only a common communicative style, but also common subjects, independent from the characteristics of each of us. Individuals are often faced with different situations. For every setting that we more frequently face in communication (for example the first interview with a parent of a very preterm infant) we have built an 'algorithm' that follows a pattern: (1) information always given; (2) frequent questions from parents; and (3) frequent difficulties in the communication. Counselling is also a tool to face some critical issue, such as the decision to open the department to parents 24 h on 24, or the promotion of mother's milk use in Very Low Birth Weight Infants (VLBWI).
