Venous oximetry and the assessment of oxygen transport balance
To review the principles of venous oximetry; the physiology of oxygen transport balance; clinical studies on venous oximetry; and the assignment of a classification of recommendation and level of evidence. A MEDLINE-based literature source. One of the tenets of critical care medicine is to provide a timely and accurate assessment of tissue oxygenation. In conjunction with other monitoring modalities, the routine deployment of central venous catheters readily enables the clinician to complete this task.
