Contribution of clinical laboratory to the diabetes care team: efforts in physiological laboratory
A large number of clinical laboratory technologists are qualified as diabetes educators; however, few of them actually participate in teaching patients. This is partially because it is difficult to balance their routine laboratory tasks and the work of a diabetes educator. We have introduced ultrasonic examinations of the ophthalmic artery, inspection of the R-R interval and current perceptual-threshold inspection for the early diagnosis of diabetic complications, and we have been contributing to the good medical care for diabetes. Furthermore, to care for diabetic foot lesions, clinical laboratory technologists have participated in checking diabetic patients' feet since 2007. In concrete terms, we examine the feet of diabetic patients, take digital pictures of the feet, and write a report, while preparing for thermographic examination of the patient. At the same time, we give simple guidance about foot care. Technologists cannot perform medical treatment; however, this has been accepted by medical staff because we only check foot lesions. We make use of existing medical imaging and reporting systems in the physiological laboratory, so doctors and nurses on the diabetic care team can always obtain information about the patients. Such actions have a good reputation not only among medical staff but also among diabetic patients.
