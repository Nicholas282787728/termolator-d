Synthesis, Crystal Structure and Fluorescence Properties of Two Tb(III) Complexes
Two coordination polymers with formula of [Tb(3-SBA) (IP)OH(H2O)] Â· H2O(1) and [Tb(dpdc)1.5 (IP) (H2O)]n (2) (3-SBA==3-sulfobenzoate, dpdc=2,2'-diphenyldicarboxylate and IP=1H-imidazo[4,5-f][1,10]-phenanthroline) have been synthesised under hydrothermal condition and characterizated by X-ray single crystal diffraction. The complex 1 possesses a 1D chain structure constructed from Tb(III) ions by 3-SBA ligands and OH groups. Complex 2 shows a 1D chain structure constructed from Tb(III) ions by dpdc ligands. The two complexes display the characteristic (5)D4-->7Fj (J=6-3) transitions at 492, 544,584 and 619 nm of Tb(III) ion, respectively. No emission from the ligand could be observed, which indicates that the ligands absorb and transfer energy efficiently to central Tb( M) ion. The emission decay curves reveal a monoexponential behaviour yielding the lifetime values of 0.287 ms for 1 and 0.439 ms for 2. The quantum yields of luminescence are 9.28% for 1 and 7.07% for 2.
