Monitoring in pediatric cardiac critical care: a worldwide perspective
Our ability to directly monitor the mechanisms that govern cellular function, oxygen use, and survival is minimal. Therefore, in critically ill children, surrogate markers are used to try to detect evolving or established hypoxia. These surrogate markers are best used in combination and are complementary to clinical examination. Regardless of resource limitations, we propose that the availability of certain monitoring tools form a standard of care without which pediatric cardiac critical care cannot be safely or optimally provided. These tools include standard invasive hemodynamic monitoring with electrocardiography, lactate measurement, central venous oxygen saturation, and echocardiography. Ultimately, monitoring is only useful when the clinician observes a specific value or trend and has the expertise to act appropriately.
