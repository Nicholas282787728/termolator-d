REITER'S SYNDROME FOLLOWING INTRAVASICAL BCG THERAPY FOR UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA. SUMMARY OF CASE REPORTS OVER THE PAST 13 YEARS IN JAPAN, INCLUDING OUR CURRENT 6 CASES
Reiter's syndrome is one of the rare complications following intravesical bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) treatment. In this study we have reviewed and discussed 101 cases including our own 6 cases over the past 13 years in Japan (2000-2013). The patients comprised 70 males and 25 females (6 cases were unknown), mean age of 63.1 (range 42 - 91). Arthritis occured 4-5 days after conjunctivitis. Thirty five (55%) of 68 patients needed corticosteroid treatment to control their arthritis. HLA-B27 is known as a risk factor of Reiter's syndrome, however, positive rate was only 2.4% (n = 41).
