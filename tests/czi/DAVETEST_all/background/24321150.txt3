Treatment of multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica in children and adolescents
Paediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for up to 5% of all MS cases. No therapies have been formally approved for paediatric patients with MS. However, there is published experience on the use of disease modifying therapies in children and adolescents with MS. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune inflammatory disease preferentially targeting the optic nerves and spinal cord. This devastating disease usually requires preventive therapy with a range of immunosuppressive medications. There are limited studies informing the use of these medications in children with NMO. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the published literature on therapeutic interventions in children and adolescents with MS and NMO.
