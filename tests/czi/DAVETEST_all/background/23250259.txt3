Victims of traffic occurrence submitted to surgery procedures: characteristics and perioperative complications
This study aimed to characterize the victims of traffic occurrence submitted to anesthetic-surgical procedures according to demographics and clinical data and identify the predictors of complications during the perioperative period (hemorrhagic shock and death). A cross-longitudinal analysis developed from the consultations of patients´ records submitted to surgery at a hospital in São Paulo city. There was predominance of young, male, and motorcycle/cyclist accident victims who received prehospital support in 69 analyzed patients. The abdomen as the most severely injured region, Injury Severity Score, general and orthopedic surgeries variables showed statistically significant association with shock and death. Age was only associated with shock. In the final model, the Injury Severity Score was predictor for shock and death, and general surgery only for shock. Orthopedic surgery was a protection factor for death. These findings subsidize the surgical team in strategic planning that aims to decrease undesirable outcomes.
