Cosmetics in skin aging
Regarding the new active substance proposed to fight against skin-aging, is it possible to talk about cosmetic revolution? According to the first definition, a revolution is a regular movement that brings an object at its initial place. If we look up the pharaonic period, for instance, we realize that we haven't invented much. This definition is really far away from the actual meaning of the word: a movement that changes the data and deviates from its initial point. We finally have two opposite values: a return to the past and a new beginning; we could say a change in continuity. This last definition seems to match with the aging cosmetology which benefits today from means of modern investigations to show some of its effects determined clinically and which registers very broadly in a worry of health and ease for each of us.
