Significant reduction of central line-associated bloodstream infection rates in a tertiary neonatal unit
To evaluate the effectiveness of a quality initiative in reducing central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) in our neonatal intensive care unit, we designed a prospective study (January 2012-September 2013) estimating CLABSI incidence before and after our implementation. CLABSI rates were significantly decreased after our intervention, from 12 cases per 1,000 central vascular catheter (CVC) days during the preinterventional period to 3.4 cases per 1,000 CVC days during the postinterventional period (P = .004).
