Polymorphism of metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-2 in risk of laryngeal cancer
The laryngeal cancer is the most common malignancy of the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Recent studies have revealed the role of genetic variations in the risk for laryngeal cancer. Polymorphic genes of matrix metalloproteinases may affect an individual genetic predisposition to the occurrence and clinical implications of the disease. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY: was to evaluate the role of polymorphic variants of MMP-1 and MMP-2 genes in the development of laryngeal carcinoma. DNA was extracted from 633 individuals including 261 patients with laryngeal carcinoma and 372 healthy volunteers. Genotyping was carried out using TaqMan(®) SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems, USA). The distribution of polymorphisms of metalloproteinases were analysed: -1607 1G/2G MMP-1 and -1306 C/T MMP-2 gene. The distribution of genotypes of -1607 1G/2G MMP-1 polymorphism was significantly different in controls vs patients (χ(2) 15.05, p 0.001). The 2G allele carriers of MMP-1 -1607 1G/2G polymorphism were at higher risk for laryngeal carcinoma development (p 0.001). In the present study, 2G/2G polymorphic variant was the independent factor of cancer development (p=0.0015). Presented data suggest an implication of MMP-1 polymorphisms in the laryngeal carcinoma susceptibility. The presence of the MMP-1 2G allele seemed to be associated with increased risk for the disease. In summary, the current study have provided the evidence that an individual's risk for carcinoma of larynx is modulated by genetic factors.
