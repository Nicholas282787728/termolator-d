Color-Doppler imaging and arteriovenous fistula: preoperative evaluation and surveillance
The native arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred vascular access for hemodialysis because of the lower incidence of complications and longer survival in comparison to grafts and central venous catheters. The use of color-Doppler sonography in the surgery of vascular accesses has increased the number of patients that are eligible for AVF as it allows to optimize the search for vessels suitable for surgical intervention (preoperative vascular mapping). Furthermore, color-Doppler imaging (CDI) has improved the survival of native AVF by increasing the early diagnosis of complications (postoperative surveillance). CDI is the only imaging technique able to provide both morphological and functional information about native vascular access and it is the only tool directly available to the nephrologist. This aspect is undoubtedly an additional value. Here we present a survey of the applications of CDI in the surgery and followup of AVF, with particular reference to preoperative mapping, AVF maturation and surveillance.
