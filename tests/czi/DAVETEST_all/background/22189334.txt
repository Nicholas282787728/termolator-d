The effect of telecommunication(with Skype)to improve a cognitive function for elderly patients with dementia and to reduce a care burden for their care givers
We conducted an intervention study to clarify how effectively videophone(Skype)was used in the communication for elderly patients with dementia being cared at home and their caregivers. For a period of 12 weeks, a patient-caregiver pair(n =8)communicated with a nurse via computer for 30 minutes once a week. The patient and caregiver worked as a pair. Before and after 12-week study period started, the intervention and control group(n=8)patients were assessed on cognitive scale(HDS-R), ADL, care burden scale(J-ZBI_8)and hours of sleep for caregivers. The result on the 12th week showed a significant improvement in hours of sleep on the intervention group of caregivers, and signs of improvement on the intervention group of patients in HDS-R. According to a questionnaire survey for caregivers, many of them said that a videophone communication was a pleasant experience for the family, and it is also useful for information gathering. Therefore, we think that the videophone communication is useful for a cognitive rehab work and giving good feelings for the patient. It also gives a good satisfaction for the family. Furthermore, a patient who had an intervention for 3 times in 2 years showed a sign of improvements in the cognitive function and care burden scale during the intervention period. However, the score dropped for several months. Therefore, it is important that a continuous intervention is necessary.
