A psychometric evaluation of the Korean version of the evidence-based practice questionnaire for nurses
Abstract Background: Measurement of evidence-based practice (EBP) competence is a challenge in the health care setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire (EBPQ). Data were collected from Korean clinical nurses (N = 801) who worked in acute care settings. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were performed to assess its construct validity. Concurrent validity and internal consistence were also assessed. Findings identified that EFA revealed a three-factor solution with 64.4% of total variance explained. The factor loadings ranged from 0.431 to 0.900 for the 24 items. The instrument showed good reliability and concurrent validity with the Critical Thinking Disposition scale. CFA revealed that the Korean version of the EBPQ was acceptable. The Korean version of the EBPQ is a valid and reliable evaluation measure of EBP competencies of nurses in South Korea.
