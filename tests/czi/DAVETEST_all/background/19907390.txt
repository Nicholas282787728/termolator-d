One specialty at a time: achieving competency in geriatrics through an e-learning neurology clerkship module
E-learning integrated into traditional clerkships may supplement gaps in medical student training, such as geriatrics competencies. An e-module, Neurology and Dementia: Psychosocial Aspects of Care, was offered during the M3 Neurology clerkship. OSCE scores were compared between students who did and did not complete the e-module with written examination scores as control. Students who completed the e-module had significantly higher scores on the standardized patient (SP) evaluation, written note, and attention to psychosocial aspects of care (P < .05 for all). Exam scores were unaffected (P = .24). Students delaying the OSCE by four weeks still showed retention of this learning. An e-module addressing geriatrics core competencies presented during a neurology rotation resulted in sustained learning of these vital concepts.
