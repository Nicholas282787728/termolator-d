Physician-initiated daily verbal reminders decrease the duration of indwelling urinary catheter use compared with nurse-initiated reminders
We compared the effectiveness of physician-initiated daily verbal reminders to primary care providers with nurse-initiated daily verbal reminders in decreasing the duration of inappropriate indwelling urinary catheter use in hospitalized patients. Catheter use duration was significantly decreased in the physician-initiated intervention group compared with the nurse-initiated intervention group (0.5 ± 0.8 vs 1.7 ± 2.7 days, respectively; P = .03).
