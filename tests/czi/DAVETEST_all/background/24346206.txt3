Photography and its doubles: a picture on the wall
Hans Belting suggests that 'images are the nomads of media' because they set up and dismantle their camps every time new media appear. Whenever photography portrays another image (painting, TV screen) it plays out a chapter in this history. Photography has been the guardian of the paradoxes in the distance and tensions between image and world in modern times. This is why it now holds a central position in the debate about contemporary visuality. Our fate and the fate of images are somehow interconnected. The last generation of visual artists from the twentieth century sought to express the pain of virtualization; twenty-first century photography is rediscovering the promise of a latent body in each image.
