Sudden cardiac death due to triple myocardial bridging associated with atypical coronary topography
Myocardial bridging (MB) is defined as the presence of an intramural course of a coronary artery, most likely caused by a defect in resorption of the musculature that encircles the epicardial arteries during morphogenesis. We present a case of the young man who died suddenly while playing professional football and whose cause of death was acute myocardial infarction associated with multiple myocardial bridges (1.8 cm on the anterior interventricular artery, 1.3 cm on the circumflex artery, and an intramyocardial trajectory of the posterior interventricular artery), and discuss the causes of death and possible consequences of this pathology.
