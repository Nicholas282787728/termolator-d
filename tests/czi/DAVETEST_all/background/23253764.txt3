Antiretroviral prophylaxis for sexual and injection drug use acquisition of HIV
During the past few years, much has been learned about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) of HIV from studies conducted in the U.S. and elsewhere. A review and summary was conducted of articles and reports published through August 2012 on the safety and efficacy of PrEP in humans; U.S.-based studies assessing PrEP knowledge, attitudes, and use among at-risk populations and healthcare providers; and models of the cost effectiveness of PrEP. PrEP is generally safe and effective and may be cost effective in a targeted population. Awareness and interest in PrEP are increasing. PrEP is an important new addition to HIV prevention services, but continued study is warranted.
