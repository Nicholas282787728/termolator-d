Orientation, containment and the emergence of symbolic thinking
Orientation is viewed in this paper as an important dimension of containment for the development of thinking. Orientation refers to the particular positioning in space and time of mother and infant so they can find one another and then containment can take place. Bion's container-contained model for the development of thinking is based on the capacity of the mother's mind to function as a 'home' for the infant's primitive projections. Containment and orientation are explored in relation to an ancient Greek object called 'σύμβολον' [symbolon], which I use here as a metaphor for the early negotiation between mother and infant to achieve a correct matching to each other's orientation. This is then mobilized and re-enacted between analyst and patient in the psychoanalytic process. Orientation as part of the container-contained model enables us to view the development of thinking from a new perspective with greater integration of cognitive and emotional aspects. The clinical implication of the concept of orientation is explored in relation to the process of engagement/disengagement between analyst and patient and is illustrated by clinical material.
