Surgical anatomy of the orbital region, local anesthesia and general considerations
Orbital region may be divided into four sectors: medial canthus, lateral canthus, lower lid and upper lid. A vertical section of a lid shows 5 layers: skin, subcutaneous tissue with orbicularis muscle, fibrous layer (tarsus-aponeurosis), plain fibers muscle layer (Muller's), conjunctiva. The first two layers form the anterior lamella and the other ones the posterior lamella, divided by the grey line. In this review Authors describe with all details the orbital region and the eyelid layers, considering the most important concepts for surgery. Finally they resume basics of local anesthesia in ophthalmoplastic surgery.
