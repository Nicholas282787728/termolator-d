G protein regulation of neuronal calcium channels: back to the future
Neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels have evolved as one of the most important players for calcium entry into presynaptic endings responsible for the release of neurotransmitters. In turn, and to fine-tune synaptic activity and neuronal communication, numerous neurotransmitters exert a potent negative feedback over the calcium signal provided by G protein-coupled receptors. This regulation pathway of physiologic importance is also extensively exploited for therapeutic purposes, for instance in the treatment of neuropathic pain by morphine and other Î¼-opioid receptor agonists. However, despite more than three decades of intensive research, important questions remain unsolved regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of direct G protein inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels. In this study, we revisit this particular regulation and explore new considerations.
