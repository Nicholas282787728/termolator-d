The reliability of using postero-anterior cephalometry and cone-beam CT to determine transverse dimensions in clinical practice
This study primarily aimed to assess the accuracy of classically-advocated reference points for the measurement of transverse jaw-base and dental relationships using conventional Postero-Anterior Cephalometry (PAC) and Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT). PAC and CBCT images were collected from 31 randomly selected orthodontic patients (12 males, 19 females), all of whom had a full permanent dentition. The transverse widths of the maxilla, mandible and the dentition were measured using reference points on both image modalities. Confidence intervals, intra-class coefficients and Bland Altman plots were used to assess the measurement differences derived from the two acquirement methods. Measurements on PAC and CBCT images demonstrated statistically significant differences in the majority of the assessed variables. The interjugal (J-J) width was one of only two variables which did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference on image comparison. The mean differences of the antegonial width (Ag-Ag) (-4.44mm, 95% CI -5.38 to -3.51) represented the greatest difference between the imaging techniques. The application of these points to a transverse skeletal analysis (J-J/Ag-Ag ratio) revealed that five of the 31 subjects (16%) recorded 'false positive' readings according to the derived data. It is recommended that clinicians are cautious when interpreting and making decisions related to transverse dimensions derived from a PAC. The PAC has a higher tendency to falsely identify individuals who require maxillary expansion procedures based on conventional clinical criteria. The errors primarily associated with identifying structures which represent the width of the mandible are significant in both PAC and CBCT techniques and require further investigation. It is postulated that the confounding effects of overlying soft tissues have a sianificant impact on a clinician's ability to identify relevant landmarks.
