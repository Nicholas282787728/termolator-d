Reorganization of brain cortex after spinal cord injury based on functional magnetic resonance imaging techniques
To explore the reorganization of brain cortex on spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques and elucidate its recurring patterns so as to provide theoretic rationales for SCI treatment. We designed different tasks for 9 SCI patients and 10 normal subjects. The tasks were named block design and it was divided into rest period (R) and stimulating period (S). All subjects underwent fMRI scan while they were performing the tasks. A significant reorganization occurred on brain cortex of SCI patients after spinal cord injury. This phenomenon changed with elapsing time after spinal cord injury. Brain cortex undergoes reorganization after spinal cord injury, especially primary sensory and motor cortex.
