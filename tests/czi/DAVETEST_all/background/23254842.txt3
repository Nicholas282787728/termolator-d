Health professions educators as agents of change in Tanzania: creativity to implement new curricula
Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) strives to instill in its graduates skills and competencies appropriate to serving the Tanzanian population well. MUHAS leadership, working in collaboration with educators from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), selected and trained an interdisciplinary group of faculty members to promote effective teaching. We describe the development of this group of faculty change agents - now known as the Health Professions Educators Group (HPEG). The HPEG invigorated the education environment at MUHAS by: engaging many colleagues in special training events that introduced new methods for teaching and assessment; encouraging innovation; and developing strong mentoring relationships. HPEG members piloted courses in education to prepare all postgraduate students as peer educators, teaching assistants, and as candidates for faculty future appointments. Creation of a 'teaching commons' reinforces the new focus on innovative teaching as faculty members share experiences and gain recognition for their contributions to quality education.
