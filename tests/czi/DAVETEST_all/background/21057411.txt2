Effectiveness of the integrated long-term program of management of patients after first psychotic episode in 5-year follow-up
The Early Intervention Centre (First episode clinic, FEC) that provides specific service programs to this particular target group of patients with early psychosis opened in November 2000 as a day clinic at the Moscow Research Institute of Psychiatry. To date, FEC programs consistent with the developed model have been established in 30 regions across Russia. 5-year follow-up data are available for 114 patients who received such care in the FEC. In more than 30% of cases complete remission was maintained over the 5 years. The number of relapses increased on the 2nd and 3rd years, but later decreased more than by one half. The relapses were mostly treated in day clinic or outpatient settings and did not require hospital admissions. More than 73% of the patients maintained their social achievements with no losses. By the end of the 5th year only 1/5 of the cases were formally recognized as unemployable due to psychiatric disability. Significantly better clinical and psychosocial outcomes have been shown in comparison with a control group of patients, treated in routine psychiatric services.
