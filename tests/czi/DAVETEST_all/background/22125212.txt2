Derivatives of 1,4-dihydropyridines as priviledged structures and their pharmacological potential
Derivatives of 1,4-dihydropyridine belong to group of calcium channel blockers and remain large group of antihypertensive agents. Particular chemical structure and presence of highly reactive binding groups make 1,4-dihydropyridines privileged structures, which can be modified and change their pharmacological effects. This fact applies to new derivatives as well as metabolites of those drugs. Particularly interesting are outcomes of experiments with metabolites of furnidypine, which tend to cause different pharmacological effect, as well as have different profile of adverse effects from mother drug. Our paper concerns with potential new possibilities of using derivatives of 1,4-dihydropyridines, as well as their metabolites, as agents of more optimised effect.
