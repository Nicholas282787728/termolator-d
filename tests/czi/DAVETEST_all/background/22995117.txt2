Edwards CENTERA valve
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been adopted worldwide as a prominent therapeutic alternative for patients with high-risk severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Despite its more widespread adoption as a treatment option and the increasing experience of the centres, TAVI is still associated with complications. Therefore, improvements in transcatheter heart valve (THV) technology, such as optimisation of device function with superior deliverability, and valve repositioning, are desirable. Accordingly, this article describes the new self-expandable Edwards CENTERA THV, made of nitinol and treated bovine pericardial tissue, and delivered by a motorised low-profile delivery system which potentially permits accurate valve placement and valve repositioning by a single operator. First-in-human clinical experience with the CENTERA THV has been promising but larger series with longer follow-up are warranted to confirm these initial positive results.
