Medtronic CoreValve Evolut valve
The first member of the next generation CoreValve family is the 23 mm CoreValve® Evolut™ (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), which is indicated for an annulus range of 18 mm to 20 mm and extends the spectrum of patients with aortic stenosis that can be treated with the self-expanding CoreValve bioprosthesis. The Core-Valve Evolut provides several technical refinements and is designed to enable re-capturability in the future. Here, we report on the first case in a 93-year-old female patient who was implanted at the University Hospital Bonn, Germany, on June 1st, 2012.
