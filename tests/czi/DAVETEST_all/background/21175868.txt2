Inhibition of TNF-alpha induced-adhesion molecules by Avène Thermal Spring Water in human endothelial cells
Cell adhesion molecules, such as E-selectin or intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), play an important role in mediating leucocyte capture and rolling on the surface of blood vessels in atopic skin. The effectiveness of Avène hydrotherapy in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis has previously been demonstrated. Thus, we examined the effect of Avène Thermal Spring Water (TSW) on adhesion molecules to understand its mechanism of action. Human endothelial cells EA.hy926 were treated with tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) in the presence or not of Avène TSW during 4 h. As nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is involved in the signalisation of inflammatory mediators such as the adhesion molecules, the translocation of NF-κB in endothelial cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry with anti-NF-κBp65. The protein and mRNA levels of TNFα-induced ICAM-1 and E-selectin were assessed by ELISA assay and RT-PCR. These adhesion molecules were also detected by immunohistochemistry. Tumour necrosis factor-α induced the activation of p65 NF-κB nuclear translocation. TNFα also induced E-selectin and ICAM-1 in a dose-dependant manner in EA.hy926 endothelial cells. In the presence of Avène TSW, a significant inhibition of the TNFα-induced E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression (-22% and -7%, respectively, P < 0.05) was observed. These data suggest that Avène TSW mediated inhibition of TNFα-induced E-selectin and ICAM-1 expression. The inhibition of such adhesion molecules is attributable to the suppression of NF-κB transcription factor pathway activation.
