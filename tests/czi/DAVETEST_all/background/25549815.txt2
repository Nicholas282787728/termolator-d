Case report: Treatment failure in a case of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma
Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma (ASA) is a rare, acquired, recurrent, and transient type of keratoderma that may occur after a few minutes of exposure to water. Herein, an 18-year-old male patient who had bilateral swelling and whitish plaques on his palms and soles is presented. The lesions on soles and heels developed within short time of immersion in water and resolved after 30 min with drying. In this case, all treatment methods, previously described in the literature in similar cases (i.e., aluminum salts, urea-salicylic acid including ointments, iontophoresis, and botulinum toxin) were ineffective. ASA is a condition that has an adverse effect on life quality. Alternative treatments are needed in ASA cases who are resistant to treatment modalities mentioned in the literature.
