Detection of archaeological forgeries of Iberian lead plates using nanoelectrochemical techniques. The lot of fake plates from Bugarra (Spain)
Identification of forgeries is of considerable interest in studies of archaeological signariums and written Iberian artifacts, elements of capital importance for the knowledge of that culture, because there are many Iberian inscribed lead plate counterfeits circulating in the market and among many museum funds. A case study of identification of forgeries of archaeological lead using voltammetry of microparticles (VMP) and scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM), aided by conventional optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX) is described. The electrochemical methods are essentially non-invasive so can be applied to samples of nanoscopic size. Application to the authentication of five lead plates found in the archaeological site of Los Villaricos-Torralba (Bugarra, Spain) is described.
