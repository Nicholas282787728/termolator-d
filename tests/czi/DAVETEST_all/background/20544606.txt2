Perspectives on the crisis and challenge of cardiovascular disease in the diverse Asian populations of California
Recent data demonstrate alarming increases in mortality from cardiovascular disease and increase in risk factors that are pushing this disease to epidemic proportions in Asians living in the Bay Area of Northern California. Although genetics may have an important role, environmental factors including diet, stress and lack of exercise are contributing to the incidence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity in this population. Research at the San Francisco Heart and Vascular Institute in Daly City, California shows that this trend is continuing, and combined with a delay in seeking treatment in this diverse ethnic group, leads to poorer outcomes in revascularization therapies used to treat these patients. More intensive community education that includes patients and his/her family and more aggressive preventive treatment programs are needed to slow the progress of this growing health problem.
