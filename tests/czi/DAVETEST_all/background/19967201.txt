Pharmacological treatment of impulsivity and aggressive behavior
Impulsivity and aggressive behavior occur frequently in a variety of psychiatric disorders and neurological diseases. Two lines of treatment could be employed, the treatment of the disorder or disease in which these symptoms occur or the treatment of the impulsivity and aggressive behavior itself. This second approach considers that there are neurobiological similarities underlying these behaviors regardless of the 'primary' diagnoses with which they are associated. Imbalance between limbic bottom-up drives, exerted by structures like the amygdala, and prefrontal top-down control mechanisms could be the ultimate reason for an aggressive-impulsive behavior. The role of serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine were comprehensively investigated with regards to impulsive and aggressive behavior and these neurochemical data were further integrated with the neuroanatomical model, providing the bases to the rational pharmacological approach of these behaviors.
