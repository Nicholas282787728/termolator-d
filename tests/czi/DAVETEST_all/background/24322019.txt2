Immunofluorescence expression of Ki-67, p53 and cyclin inhibitors (p16ink4a, p21 and p27) in low-grade cervical lesions versus high-grade cervical lesions. Research study on cell cultures
The aim of this research was to assess the immunofluorescence expression (IFE) of cell cycle regulators p16ink4a, p21, p27, in association with proliferation and prognosis factors Ki-67, p53 respectively, in cell cultures, obtained from different types of cervical intra-epithelial lesions. The final purpose was to distinguish a best marker able to identify with high accuracy the high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion. The study was carried out on 68 epithelial cell cultures. Three senior specialists have analyzed 500 cells/case individually. The statistic analysis for correlation between used markers has been performed. The study batch revealed a very low expression of investigated parameters (<1%) in negative cases for malignancy and intraepithelial lesion (NMIL), a progressive exponential expression in low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), and a very high expression in high-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesion (HSIL) and invasive squamous cervical carcinoma (ISCC). Ki-67 and p53 were overexpressed in nuclei both in LSIL and HSIL. A slightly direct correlation between p21 and Ki-67 (r=0.35, p<0.001) was observed in HSIL. Statistically significant correlations were noticed between some markers: p16ink4a and p27 (r=0.4, p=0.03), p16ink4a and Ki-67 (r=-0.4, p=0.002). The most reliable parameters for assessing HSIL and ISCC proved to be Ki-67 and p16ink4a. Both were with percentages and intensity of IFE around 100% and higher immunoexpression within the nucleus of cell cultures. Our study reveals that p27 cyclin inhibitor was not reliable in differentiating between LSIL and HSIL.
