Health challenges in Tanzania: context for educating health professionals
In this commentary we introduce the population age and gender distributions, the birth rate, and life expectancy in Tanzania's largely agricultural society and highlight the vulnerable status of mothers and children. We present underlying causes of poor health, the leading causes of Disability-Adjusted Life Years and review threats from exposure to disease, toxic substances, and injuries that require protection of populations and control efforts. We summarize health challenges posed by malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS, non-communicable diseases, and by new threats that may change the picture of disease and require adjustments in how training institutions prepare the health workforce.
