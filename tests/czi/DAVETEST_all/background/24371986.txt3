A role of negative pressure therapy in the treatment of surgical wound infection after intramedullary osteosynthesis in pertrochanteric femoral fracture
Fractures of the proximal femur are specific to older adults. Today, life expectancy for men and women is increasing, so one can expect an increased number of hip fractures. Elderly people suffer from associated diseases that may compromise the biological potential in healing of surgical wounds. On the other hand, there is an increased number of microorganisms resistant to antimicrobial drugs, so an increased number of postoperative infections can be expected. With conventional treatment methods of postoperative infections where the osteo-synthetic material is present in tissue, negative pressure therapy is gradually taking an increasingly important role in the treatment of these conditions. Because of its simple application in hospital or outpatient setting and good comfort with no pain for the patient, negative pressure therapy contributes significantly to healing of the wounds without removing osteosynthetic material from the wound.
