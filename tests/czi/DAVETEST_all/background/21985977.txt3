Genetics of hypoparathyroidism and pseudohypoparathyroidism
Congenital hypoparathyroidism encompasses a series of disorders chracterized by the common biochimical feature of symptomatic hypocalcemia with concomitant hypophosphoremia. Clinical features differ among the various parathyroid-related hypocalcemic syndromes, as understandable on the basis of disorder-specific genetics. The present article reviews the various disorders related to both hypoparathyroid and pseudohypoparathyroid conditions, with a detailed report of the recent discoveries in term of the genetics of these syndromes.
