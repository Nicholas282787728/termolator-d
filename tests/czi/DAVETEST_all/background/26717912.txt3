Feature Tracking-Derived Peak Systolic Strain Compared to Late Gadolinium Enhancement in Troponin-Positive Myocarditis: A Case-Control Study
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) assesses myocardial involvement in myocarditis (MYO). Current techniques are qualitative, subjective, and prone to interpretation error. Feature tracking (FT) analyzes myocardial strain using CMR and has not been examined in MYO. We hypothesize that regional left ventricular (LV) strain is abnormal in MYO. Regional strain by FT was compared to late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and troponin leak as measures of myocardial involvement. This single-center, retrospective CMR study reviewed patients with clinical MYO and structurally normal hearts who underwent CMR at our institution. Young adults with normal cardiac anatomy, function, and absent LGE served as controls. MYO patients with documented troponin leak and normal global ejection fraction (EF > 50 %) were included in comparison. FT determined regional myocardial peak systolic strain (pkS) in longitudinal and circumferential distributions. T tests compared strain values between cases and controls. Receiver operating characteristic curves determined pkS values with highest sensitivity and specificity for concurrent troponin leak and LGE. FT was performed on 57 patients: 37 MYO and 20 controls. Twenty-eight cases with normal EF, and 20 control patients were included in final analysis. Nearly all cases with normal function demonstrated abnormal regional pkS (27/28, 96 %). Cases had significantly diminished pkS when compared to controls in all regions except the longitudinal 2C distribution. FT-derived longitudinal and circumferential pkS is sensitive and specific in identifying myocardial involvement, namely the presence of troponin leak and LGE. FT may be a useful adjunctive, objective measure of myocardial involvement in patients with MYO and normal LV function.
