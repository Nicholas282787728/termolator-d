Modification and implementation of NCCN guidelines on prostate cancer in the Middle East and North Africa region
A prostate cancer committee was established to modify the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) on Prostate Cancer for adaptation and implementation in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The objective was to enhance the multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of prostate cancer. The committee, comprising regional experts in the fields of urologic, medical, and radiation oncology, reviewed the 2009 version of the NCCN Guidelines on Prostate Cancer and suggested modifications based on the unique needs of the regions determined through published evidence and local expertise. The committee identified several areas in the NCCN Guidelines that they believed required modification, which are presented in this article. The treatment of prostate cancer in the MENA region has numerous challenges. The hope is that this effort to modify the NCCN Guidelines on Prostate Cancer for practical use in the MENA region will improve regional awareness and patient care.
