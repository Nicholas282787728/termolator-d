A comparison of the characteristics on cancer and non-cancer in-patients receiving a registration system based home support
To clarify the characteristics of cancer and non-cancer in-patients receiving a registration system based home support. A total of 254 patients who were hospitalized from April 2009 to March 2010 were included for this observational study. An analysis was made by classifying the subjects into two groups: cancer group and non-cancer group. A comparison of the two groups showed that the cancer patient group consisted of many men (p<0. 01). The average BI score in the cancer patient group tended to be high upon admission and discharge(p<0. 005). The nursing care level was low(p<0. 01), and both the average length of stay(p<0. 01)as well as the average number of admissions were low(p<0. 05). In case of readmission, both the number of days from the previous discharge until the current admission and the number of days from registration until admission were low(p<0. 01). With regard to the number of drugs administered to the cancer patient group(p<0. 01), the use of narcotics(p=0. 000)was high. Sedative measures(p<0. 01)and the percentage of patients receiving nursing instructions(p<0. 01)were also high. On the other hand, the ratio of patients receiving oral care(p<0. 05), nasolgastric-tube(p<0. 01)and PEG(p<0. 01)was low and few patients needed care in relation to respiration(p<0. 01). Dietary care, physical care, bedsores and falls were not statically significant between two groups. The hospital mortality rate was significantly higher (p<0. 01)in the cancer patient group. A comparison of cancer and non-cancer in-patients regarding the support of a home-based medical care provided through the ward revealed that both home nursing and home medical care were required. Both physical care and preventive support measures were also needed as well. Cooperation between the hospital and community needs should be addressed for an effective home-care support measure during a hospitalization.
