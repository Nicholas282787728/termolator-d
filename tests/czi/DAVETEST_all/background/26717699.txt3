Nitrogen Loss Through Different Ways in Cropland Under Conventional Fertilization: An In-situ Study of Summer Maize Season in the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River
In order to better understand the characteristics of nitrogen loss through different pathways under conventional fertilization conditions, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the variations of N2O emission, NH3 volatilization, N losses through surface runoff and leaching caused by the application of nitrogen fertilizers during summer maize growing season in the Middle and Lower reaches of the Yangtze River, China. Our results showed that when compound fertilizer was used as basal fertilizer at the nitrogen rate of 150 kg.hm-2, and urea with the same level of fertilizing as topdressing, the N2O emission coefficient in the entire growing season was 3. 3%, NH3 volatilization loss rate was 10. 2%, and nitrogen loss rate by leaching and surface runoff was 11. 2% and 5. 1%, respectively. In addition, leaching was the main pathway of nitrogen loss after basal fertilizer, while NH, volatilization and nitrogen leaching accounted for the majority of nitrogen loss after topdressing, which suggested that nitrogen loss from different pathways mainly depended on the type of nitrogen fertilizer. Taken together, it appears to be effective to apply the new N fertilizer with low ammonia volatilization instead of urea when maize needs topdressing, so as to reduce N losses from N fertilizer.
