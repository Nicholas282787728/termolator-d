Treatment of brain metastases in patients with HER2+ breast cancer
Brain metastases are a frequent complication of cancer. However, effective treatments are available. This article aims to review clinical aspects of patients with brain metastases discussing the various treatment options for such patients. It will address the importance and significance of brain metastases in patients with breast cancer and, finally, review the problem of brain metastasis associated with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. With ever-improving survival rates of patients with cancer, there is a greater likelihood that many will develop brain metastases. Treatments such as whole brain or stereotactic radiotherapy and surgery have been shown to be effective against brain metastases. In HER2+ breast cancer, trastuzumab has been shown to be very effective, although it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. If patients with breast cancer who are being treated with trastuzumab and are responding systemically, develop brain metastases, then patient prognosis does need to be taken into account; however, maintaining treatment with trastuzumab while using available therapies to treat intracranial lesions should be considered as an option.
