A community integration approach to social determinants of health in New Mexico
Lifestyle and Values Impacting Diabetes Awareness (LA VIDA), a community-based diabetes intervention program targeting Hispanics in southwestern New Mexico, addresses social determinants of health by utilizing promotores and collaborating with community partners and health care providers. Using a mixed-methods approach, a program evaluation documented the promotores' crucial role in providing social support, contributing to social cohesion, and accessing health care, community resources, and LA VIDA's educational and healthy lifestyle activities. Findings suggest that patients with diabetes who participated in the LA VIDA program significantly increased the number of days they checked their feet and took their diabetes medications and significantly lowered their glycated hemoglobin levels.
