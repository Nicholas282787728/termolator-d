Research on Spectrum Radiation Characteristics of a New Type Infrared/ Ultraviolet Dual Color Decoy
The advantage of traditional MTV infrared decoys which are mainly consist of magnesium, Teflon and VITON is that it emits high radiant energy, so it is an effective countermeasure to traditional seekers which seek the target by heat source. The spectral radiant intensity which generated from high temperature combustion of MTV infrared decoys in near infrared region and ultraviolet band is very high, and that in Mid-IR region is relative lower, however the radiant intensity of real jet fighter in ultraviolet band is low and the infrared radiant intensity ratio of Mid-IR to near IR band is greater than 1. Thus, the traditional MTV infrared decoys are hardly able to counter the seekers equipped with dual color combined guidance system. Based on the spectral matching principle, we designed and prepared a new infrared/ultraviolet dual color decoy which is mainly consist of oxidant (wt% 45-75), fuel (wt% 10-25), energetic binder (wt% 25-50) and additives. We conducted theoretical calculations on combustion products of the reagent combinations using CEA (Chemic equilibrium                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I(3-5 microm) : I(1-3 microm)  3). The infrared radiant intensity in 3-5 pLm band is tunable from 0.9 to 2.5 kW x sr(-1) while the ultraviolet radiant intensity in 0.3-0.5 microm is about (20 +/- 5)W x sr(-1). The flame temperature is between 850-1100 degrees C. It is proved that the dual color decoy as-designed has excellent characteristics.
