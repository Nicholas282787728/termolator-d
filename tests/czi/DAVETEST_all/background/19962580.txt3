The use of immunoglobulin therapy for patients undergoing solid organ transplantation: an evidence-based practice guideline
This guideline for the use of immunoglobulin (IG) for sensitized patients undergoing solid organ transplantation (SOT) is an initiative of the Canadian Blood Services and the National Advisory Committee on Blood and Blood Products of Canada to (1) provide guidance for Canadian practitioners involved in the care of patients undergoing SOT and transfusion medicine specialists on the use of IG and (2) standardize care, limit adverse events, and optimize patient care. A systematic expert and bibliography literature search up to July 2008 was conducted, with 791 literature citations and 45 reports reviewed. To validate the recommendations, the guideline was sent to physicians involved in SOT in Canada and a patient representative. The recommendations identify (1) sensitized patients undergoing SOT that would have a better survival and decreased morbidity by receiving IG preoperatively, postoperatively, and for the treatment of organ rejection; (2) patients who may not have any benefit from receiving IG; and (3) potential adversities to IG.
