Lichen planus secondary complications associated with the use of biologic therapy for rheumatoid arthritis
Biologic therapy such as Etanercept, which is a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±) inhibitor, has been extensively used as election therapy in rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this case presentation was to inform about the possibility that lichen planus lesions could potentially become complicated by secondary infections in patients treated with Etanercept. Furthermore, we aimed at analyzing if the complication of the cutaneous lesion was coincidental or it was due to the immunosuppressive systemic therapy, and whether the infected lesion would respond to antibiotic therapy. The patient was a 59-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis and that have had lichen planus lesions for approximately 25 years. Only recently, she had been received immunosuppressive therapy (Etanercept and Methotrexate). Further on, the lichen planus flared up with a secondary infection determined by a Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Uncommon myocardial complications were also characteristic of this case. While a case report described already the appearance of lichen planus following Etanercept therapy (Battistella M et al., 2008), the possibility that the lesion could become secondary complicated following this therapy was never reported before, according to our knowledge. Additionally, we describe in this case the interplay between Etanercept therapy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our case is not a lichen planus induced by Etanercept, but it is aggravated and secondary infected with Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus during the therapy. The additional cardiac complication (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) may represent solely an evolutive sign of rheumatoid arthritis and therefore not influenced by Etanercept.
