Epileptic motor behaviors during sleep: anatomo-electro-clinical features
Sleep-related complex motor seizures have long been considered pathognomonic features of Nocturnal Frontal Lobe Epilepsy (NFLE). In recent years, these manifestations have also been reported to have a temporal or insular origin. We describe 40 drug-resistant epileptic patients with complex motor seizures during sleep, submitted to presurgical stereo-EEG (SEEG) evaluation and seizure-free after surgical resection of the epileptogenic zone. In a significant proportion (30%) of these patients, seizures arose from extra-frontal regions, including mainly the temporal lobe and the insular cortex, but also the parietal and occipital lobes. In patients with extra-frontal epilepsy, when complex motor behaviors appeared, SEEG revealed that the ictal discharge involved the cingulate and the frontal regions. Finally, at histology, Taylor's focal cortical dysplasia (TFCD) was the most common finding (90% of patients), independent of the site of seizure onset. As previously reported by other studies, this histologic substrate may be a major determinant of sleep-related seizures in drug-resistant epileptic patients.
