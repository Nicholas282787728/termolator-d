A history of simulation-enhanced interprofessional education
This article explores the evolution and history of interprofessional education (IPE) using healthcare simulation (HCS). The evolution described here demonstrates an achievement of patient safety efforts as a consequence of the historical roots of healthcare and highlights HCS as a progressive method synergistic with IPE. This paper presents a descriptive review that covers the HCS and IPE literature, indicating factors that led to the use of HCS in IPE. Understanding the history of simulation-enhanced IPE provides healthcare educators with fertile ground to support future IPE. A number of benefits in using HCS to address common challenges to IPE are outlined, including natural relevance and engagement for learners, faculty attraction to its use, and the opportunity to explore socio-historical issues in teams. Several promising directions for future research are suggested.
