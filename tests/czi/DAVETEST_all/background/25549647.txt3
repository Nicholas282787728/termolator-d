Clinical outcomes of mini-invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion under Quadrant system for upper lumbar disc herniation
To evaluate the treatment outcomes of mini-invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion by Quadrant system for upper lumbar disc herniation. Between February 2008 and June 2011, 21 patients with upper lumbar disc herniation underwent mini-invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion under Quadrant system at our institution. The relevant patient data included visual analogue scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores before and after operation 1 week, 3 months and last follow-up. And all data were collected retrospectively. No operation-related complications occurred. The mean operative duration was 2.8 (2.5-3) hours. The average blood loss volume was 430 (350-500) ml. Preoperative VAS was 7.3 ± 0.8 and 2.1 ± 0.9, 1.3 ± 0.6, 0.6 ± 0.5 after operation 1 week, 3 months and last follow-up respectively. Statistically significant differences were demonstrated between each group. Preoperative ODI was 43.7 ± 12.9 and 22.5 ± 10.4, 16.2 ± 8.5, 11.3 ± 7.2 after operation 1 week, 3 months and last follow up. Significant differences existed in preoperative and postoperative ODI scores respectively. Mini-invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using Quadrant system and special osteotome is safe and efficacious for upper lumbar disc herniation.
