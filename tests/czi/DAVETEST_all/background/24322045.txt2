Littoral cell angioma of the spleen--a surprising cause of anemia
Littoral cell angioma is a rare tumor of the spleen, usually being considered benign and typically discovered incidentally. There are three different modalities of presentation: tumoral splenomegaly, long-standing iron deficient anemia or thrombocytopenia due to hypersplenism. However, some of its manifestations could generate the suspicion of a lymphoma or other more serious condition. We present the case of a 46-year-old man with splenomegaly and iron deficiency anemia. The tumor affected the whole spleen, which was surgically removed. The histopathological examination, together with immunophenotyping, established the diagnosis. Six months after the procedure, the patient is in very good condition. Several differential diagnoses were discussed, as well as the prognostic factors. The case illustrates a rare cause of anemia and the importance of pathology in uncovering such unusual causes for this.
