Amendment to 2010 Italian guidelines for the establishment and operation of a donor human milk bank
The present paper is an amendment to the recent Italian Guidelines of human milk banking published in 2010. Working Group on Guidelines (Panel) of the Italian Association of Human Milk Banks (AIBLUD) states, in accordance with the European Union Comission's Amending Directive of January 2011, that the hard plastic feeding bottles used in the collection, storage and pasteurization of the human milk should be Bisphenol A (BPA) free. Until new evidence are available polycarbonate feeding bottles should not be used for collection, storage and pasteurization of human milk. The paper summarizes the former and current European Commission Directives and shows the related amending changes to the 2010 Italian Human Milk Banking Guidelines.
