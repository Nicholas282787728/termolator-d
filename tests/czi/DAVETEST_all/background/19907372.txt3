Composite score validity in clerkship grading
Composite score validity depends on its reliability, content, and comparison with other outcomes measures. This study examined all three aspects of a composite score used in a third-year surgery clerkship. Composite score reliability was calculated using stratified alpha; several other reasonable composite combinations were tested. Correlation coefficients between clerkship composite scores and grades were calculated with other achievement measures. Two consecutive years were studied (N = 162, N = 159). The clerkship composite score reliability was .76 (Year 1) and .81 (Year 2). Positive correlations (P  or= .05) were found between composite scores and other clerkships' test scores and the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 2 Clinical Knowledge examination. Positive correlations (P  or= .05) were found between surgery clerkship grades and other clerkship grades. This study documents the reliability of a composite score and provides evidence for its validity in a surgery clerkship.
