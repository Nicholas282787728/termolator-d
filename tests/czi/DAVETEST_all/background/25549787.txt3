Optimal loads for a 30-s maximal power cycle ergometer test using a stationary start
A stationary start modification to the Wingate Anaerobic Test (WAnT) has become increasingly common. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the traditional 85 g kg(-1) body weight (BW) load (TRAD), or an individualized optimal load (OPT), is more suitable for obtaining peak and mean power outputs (PPO and MPO, respectively) for a stationary start. Twelve recreationally active males and 10 females (mean age 30 ± 9.1 and 25 ± 5.5 years, respectively) completed three trials. The first determined the OPT load and included a familiarization of the 30-s stationary start test, followed by two randomized sessions testing the OPT and TRAD loads during the 30-s stationary start test on separate days. For each test, measures of power (watts), time, and cadence were collected to determine PPO, MPO, rate of power decline (rPD) and time to peak power (TtPP). All power data were corrected for flywheel moment of inertia. Results revealed significant differences between OPT and TRAD load settings for males (95.1 ± 10.7 and 85.06 ± 0.40 g kg(-1) BW; p = 0.008) but not for females (84.71 ± 8.72 and 85.2 ± 0.61 g kg(-1) BW; p = 0.813). Relative PPO was not different for OPT or TRAD loads for males (p = 0.485) or females (p = 0.488). It is not necessary to use an OPT load setting to acquire maximal PO for a 30-s cycle test using a stationary start. Instead, the traditional 85 g kg(-1) BW loading is suitable for both males and females.
