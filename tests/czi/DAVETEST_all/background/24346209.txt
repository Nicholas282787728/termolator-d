The magazineSaúde em Debateas a source and object of study
This research note is about a study of Centro Brasileiro de Estudos da Saúde (Brazilian Center for Health Studies, Cebes) and the sanitation reform movement conducted within the ambit of the History of Science and Public Health program at Casa de Oswaldo Cruz. The study focuses on Saúde em Debate, the periodical published by Cebes, because of the importance it had during its ten-year existence. The use of the periodical in the research brought to light some issues concerning the participation of its members in the sanitation reform. It is shown how the use of the publication as a source and object of study in research in the area of health deserves broader investigation.
