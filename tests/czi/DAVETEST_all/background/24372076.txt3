Potent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors and their biology
The Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3k) is an important regulator of intracellular signalling pathways, like cell proliferation, migration, survival, and angiogenesis upon activation by growth factor or receptors. The PI3k's pathway is frequently up-regulated in human cancers, thus inhibition of PI3k's is a promising approach for cancer therapy. Many potent PI3k's inhibitors have been reported so far and few of them are in clinical trial like GDC-0941, BGT-226, AZD-6482 and others are natural products etc.
