Local government management regarding the quality of children's healthcare
Assessing the quality of healthcare programs aimed at children and adolescents set by Colombian local governments in compliance with current legal standards. This was a descriptive study which evaluated the evidence regarding surveillance of quality systems and compliance with accessibility, opportunity, safety, continuity and relevance as indicators of quality concerning service delivery. No evidence was found showing that the local governments so examined were developing child-orientated health programs specifically addressing epidemiological reality. Ongoing activities complied with minimum legal requirements and were not being evaluated regarding their quality, meaning that an approach aimed at improvement was not being adopted. The above results are thus proposed as a working baseline and, given that the role of local government in terms of healthcare quality ranges from planning, to surveillance and quality control concerning providers, quality management programs must be implemented before new healthcare programs are introduced.
