Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollutants Removal by Enhanced Riverbank Interception Facilities Under Different Operating Conditions
Treatment of agricultural non-point source pollution in a pilot scale by enhanced riverbank interception facilities with different temperatures, rainfall intensities and rainfall interval conditions was investigated. The results showed that if water temperature decreased from 20 degrees to 4. 3 degrees, the removal efficiencies of COD, TN, NH4+ -N, TP decreased by 15. 58%, 48. 93%, 42. 26%, 57. 75% respectively, and no significant effect on the removal of SS was found. If rainfall intensity increased doubled from 0.65 mm.min-1 to 1. 30 mm.min-1, it made the average removal rate of COD decrease 15. 19%, TN, NH4+ -N did not change and removal efficiency of TP increased 11.21%. But the total removed quantity per unit area of COD, TN, NH4+ -N, TP increased by 26. 27%, 68. 3%, 32. 6%, and 104. 2%. If rainfall interval increased from 2 to 4 days, it would make NH4+ -N, TN removal efficiencies increase by 19. 31%, 13. 95% respectively, and the removed quantity per unit area of TP increased 71. 43%, but the total removal quantity of TP was limited.
