Preliminary study on combined pharmacological and laser treatment in optic pit serous maculopathy after literature review
The pit of the optic nerve head (ON) is a rare congenital defect that sometimes presents itself with a maculopathy of various neuroretinal layers for unknown reason. This study was focused, before and after pharmacological and parasurgical treatment, on the structural and functional visual assessment in a patient with optic pit maculopathy (OPM). In order to achieve this the latest generation of hi-tech diagnostic tests were used, such as Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP), full-field Electroretinography (ERG), multifocal ERG (mfERG), Microperimetry (MP-1), Standard Automated Perimetry (SAP), Fluorescein Angiography (FA) and Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICG). The research was conducted through a review of past and recent literature.
