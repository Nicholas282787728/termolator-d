Evaluation of the launch of an unambiguous patient identification strategy in the hospitals of the Valencian Healthcare Agency (Spain)
Identification problems are associated with errors arising in the course of providing patient care. To improve patient safety, a universal and unambiguous identification system is required. The aim of this study was to assess the experience of designing, implementing and evaluating the launch of a strategy for unambiguous patient identification, using an identification bracelet in all the hospitals of the Valencian Healthcare Agency. The assessment included the design of the identification material (bracelet) and its contents; the production, placement and identification of the bracelets, and the degree of implementation achieved at the launch of this strategy. The identification strategy was successfully implemented in a satisfactory proportion of sites (100% of the hospitals and 76% of hospital emergency departments within the first 24 hours of its functioning). Evaluation of the points defined as critical also showed high levels of compliance. Overall, the experience described could help the deployment of similar efforts in other centers and health services.
