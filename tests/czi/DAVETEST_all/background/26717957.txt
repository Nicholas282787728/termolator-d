Applicability of the SMART Model of Transition Readiness for Sickle-Cell Disease
This study aimed to examine the applicability of the Social-ecological Model of Adolescent and Young Adult Readiness to Transition (SMART) model for adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle-cell disease (SCD).  METHODS:  14 AYA with SCD (14-24 years old) and 10 clinical experts (6-20 years of experience) completed semi-structured interviews. AYA completed brief questionnaires. Interviews were coded for themes, which were reviewed to determine their fit within the SMART model.  RESULTS:  Overall, most themes were consistent with the model (e.g., sociodemographics/culture, neurocognition/IQ, etc.). Factors related to race/culture, pain management, health-care navigation skills, societal stigma, and lack of awareness about SCD were salient for AYA with SCD.  CONCLUSIONS:  Findings suggest the SMART model may be appropriate in SCD with the consideration of disease-related stigma. This study is a step toward developing a disease-specific model of transition readiness for SCD. Future directions include the development of a measure of transition readiness for this population.
