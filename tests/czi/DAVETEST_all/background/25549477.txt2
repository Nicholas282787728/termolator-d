Comparative evaluation of antioxidant activity and content of prooxidant factors in different classes of foods
By using the biophysical methods (chemiluminescence, amperometry) in laboratory in vitro experiments it was demonstrated that the study of antioxidant and pro-oxidant activities of different food groups allows to perform a preliminary assessment of their pro-oxidant-antioxidant capacity. It have been shown that some food prevails ability to exert pro-oxidant effects (in vitro) due to the short-term induction of free radical oxidation. Thus, among the fresh juices the increase of the maximum of flash chemiluminescence has been detected in avocado (1080, 89%) and pearjuices (136,33%), whereas the lowest ability to enhance the intensity of free radical processes has been marked for pomegranate (1,63%), orange (9, 68%) and apples juices (12, 84%). Among milk products it has been marked for sour milk (9, 06%) and yogurt (15, 11-16,02%), that allows the use of the past to correct pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance diet for people with potential danger gain peroxide processes, such as special physiological states, sport endurance, mental and emotional overload. The ability to increase the intensity of free radical oxidation have been also identified for snacks, especially buns, biscuits, bread sticks, showing the risk of formation of oxidative stress in the body during their prolonged use, particularly under the above described conditions. In some cases, foods (processed cheese and cheese curds) showed dominance factors sustained oxidative effect (in 2,1-20,7%), that indicates the possibility of an imbalance in the pro-oxidant-antioxidant system after its prolonged use in the diet, even in small quantities, especially in individuals with a reduced level of antioxidant potential of the nonspecific defense system. Investigation of antioxidant activity of foods revealed significant predominance of reducing equivalents in all freshly squeezed and some packaged fruit juices, as well as dairy products, indicating their possibility to increase the capacity of reducing components of nonspecific protection system. The presence in a number of products used for snacking (chips, puffed rice) of sufficiently high levels of antioxidant activity demonstrates the content of substances that act as proton donator having significant reducing ability. It is sufficient for high energy value of such products, indicating on the possibility of involvement of their recovery factors in plastic processes with subsequent enhancement, such as lipogenesis, that may be a prerequisite for the development of obesity, atherosclerosis and otherpathological processes. Using an integrated approach will enable a timely and appropriate to correct the ratio of pro- and antioxidant indicators of diet in order to improve the adaptive capacity of the organism in a particular physiological or pathological conditions involving oxidative metabolism disorders.
