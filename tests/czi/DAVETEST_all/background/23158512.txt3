Metabolism and biological functions of human milk oligosaccharides
It is well known that breastfeeding is beneficial both for its nutritional properties and for the presence of biologically active compounds. Among these, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), representing the third largest fraction of human milk, have been assigned important biological functions, such as prebiotic and immunomodulatory and antimicrobial effects. HMOs are synthesized in the mammary gland by glycosyltransferase enzymes and can be divided in core-oligosaccharides, sialo-oligosaccharides, fucosyl-oligosaccharides and sialo-fucosyl-oligosaccharides on the basis of their chemical structure. Glycosyltransferases enzymes are partially regulated by genetic mechanisms; according to the expression of secretory and Lewis' genes, it is possible to classify human milk in 4 different secretory groups. We hereby present a review of the current knowledge concerning HMOs, their metabolism and main biological functions.
