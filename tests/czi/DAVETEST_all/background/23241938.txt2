Thyroid cysts treatment with the sclerosing agent Atossiclerol. Long-term (5 to 15 years) follow-up
The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of the sclerosing agent Atossisclerol in the treatment of benign, ecolucent, thyroid cysts. Two groups of cysts, one between 1 and 3 cm and a group smaller than 0.99 mm in maximum diameter (range 0.6-0.99) were considered in the inclusion plan. The localization of the cysts was at lobar level. A limited quantity of Atossisclerol (0.5 to 2%) was injected. No side effects were noted. After 5 years in the group treated with the sclerosing agent 93% of the cysts were completely disappeared (vs 60% in controls). However the initial target cyst at 5 and years was completely cured in most patients (>80%) treated with the sclerosing agent; at 10 years more than 90% of the original, sclerosed target cysts were not visible. Another control of most of these patients (53/68) at 15 years indicated that sclerosis of the cyst is safe and allow a better occlusion/obliteration (in almost all patients) of the cyst in comparison with aspiration only (slow recurrence in some 25% of the cysts). The sclerosing agent can be re-injected in the same patients without significant reaction or clinical problems or immunological reactions.
