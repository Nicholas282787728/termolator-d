Interpretation of mild elevation of high-sensitivity cardiac troponins
Measurements of cardiac troponins (cTn) are yet considered the gold standard method in patients with chest pain. Very recently, high-sensitivity (hs)cTn emerged and allow to measure very low concentrations of cTn. The aim of these assays was the better detection of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The threshold value should be the 99th percentile of the method, which corresponds to the concentration obtained from 99% of a reference population. These assays improve the detection of patients with elevated cTn concentrations. All patients with increased hs-cTn concentration above the 99th percentile should be considered at high risk of future clinical event when compared to patients with lower concentration. However, these elevated concentrations are not necessarily related to AMI due to coronary artery plaque rupture and superimposed thrombus. In order to understand adequately cTn measurement, the physician should base his interpretation on the context, the cTn concentration, variations during serial sampling, and the possible existence of a coexistent disease characterized by increased cTn concentrations.
