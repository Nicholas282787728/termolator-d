The effect of streptozotocin and alloxan on the mRNA expression of rat hepatic transporters in vivo
The effect of streptozotocin (STZ) and alloxan (ALX) on the hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of four transporters (Mrp2, Mdr1, Oct1, and Oatp1) was studied in the present work. After the healthy male Wistar rats were individually treated by a single intraperitoneal injection of ALX monohydrate (150 mg/kg) or STZ (50 mg/kg), the hepatic mRNA expression levels of Mrp2, Mdr1, Oct1, and Oatp1 were detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The results indicated that the mRNA expression levels of the Mrp2, Mdr1, Oct1, and Oatp1 in ALX-induced diabetic rats, as well as the hepatic mRNA expression of Mdr1 and Oatp1 in STZ-induced diabetic rats, were significantly decreased as compared with the control. The inhibition of ALX and STZ on hepatic transporter expression suggested that alterations of drug transporters under diabetic condition can be responsible for reduced drug clearance.
