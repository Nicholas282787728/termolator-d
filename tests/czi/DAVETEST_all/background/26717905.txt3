Oxidative theory of atherosclerosis and antioxidants
Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial process that begins early in infancy and affects all the humans. Early steps of atherogenesis and the evolution towards complex atherosclerotic plaques are briefly described. After a brief history of the 'Lipid theory of atherosclerosis', we report the most prominent discoveries on lipoproteins, their receptors and metabolism, and their role in atherogenesis. The main focus is the 'oxidative theory of atherosclerosis', with emphasis on free radicals and reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and LDL oxidation, biological properties of oxidized LDL and their potential role in atherogenesis. Then, we report the properties of antioxidants and antioxidant systems and their effects in vitro, on cultured cells, in animal models and in humans. The surprising discrepancy between the efficacy of antioxidants in vitro and in animal models of atherosclerosis and the lack of protective effect against cardiovascular events and death in epidemiological study and clinical trials are discussed. In contrast, epidemiological studies seem to indicate that the Mediterranean diet may protect (in part) against atherosclerosis complications (myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death).
