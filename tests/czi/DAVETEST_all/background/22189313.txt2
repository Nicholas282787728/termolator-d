Management of elderly patients with high fever
We analyzed 102 cases of data in which elderly patients with high fever received a home medical care. Our results demonstrated that 68 cases recovered within several days after taking symptom-relieving drugs and antibiotics. Thirty four cases were referred to a hospital for examinations; 25 cases resulted in admission to a hospital for further treatments. When we take care of the elderly patients with high fever, it is imperative to carefully observe the conditions of the patients and refer to a hospital in a timely and adequate manner.
