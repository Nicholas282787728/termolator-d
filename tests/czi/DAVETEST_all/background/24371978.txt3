Debridement- crucial procedure in the treatment of chronic wounds
Debridement is the process of removing dead tissue from the wound bed. Devitalized tissue can obstruct or completely stop healing of the wound. The aim of debridement is to transform a chronic wound into an acute wound and to initiate the process of healing. Debridement is the basis of each wound treatment and it has to be repeated, depending on the necrotic tissue formation. There are several types of debridement, as follows: mechanical, autolytic, chemical, enzymatic, biological, and new debridement techniques. With advances in technology, new types of debridement have been introduced. Besides standard methods, methods of pulsed lavage debridement (hydro-surgery, water-jet) and ultrasound-assisted wound treatment are ever more frequently introduced. The method of debridement the clinician will choose depends on the amount of necrotic (devitalized) tissue in the wound bed, size and depth of the wound, underlying disease, possible comorbidity, and the patient general condition. Frequently, the methods of debridement are combined in order to achieve better removal of devitalized tissue. In addition, debridement significantly reduces bacterial burden.
