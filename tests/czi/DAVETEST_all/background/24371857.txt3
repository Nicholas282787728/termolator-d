Macerated foot dermatitis related to occlusive footwear
Gram-negative bacterial toe-web infections (GNBTWI's) are relatively under-recognized among physicians. Even though skin infections are usually thought to involve gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative organisms have a particular affinity for the toe-web. We present two patients with GNBTWI's who presented with maceration of the toe-webs, vesiculopustules and a hyperkeratotic rim. Treatment includes using both oral and topical antibiotics along with antifungals to treat co-existing dermatophyte infections. Awareness of this condition is particularly important for primary care physicians in West Virginia, as a few of the potential risk factors include wearing occlusive footwear, such as work boots, and type II diabetes mellitus.
