Expression of CD57 on CD8+ T lymphocytes of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis: evidence for continuous activation of CD8+ cells
To gain insight into the immune pathogenesis of Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), the prevalence of circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes expressing CD57 as a marker for previous activation was analyzed. Receptor expression of CD57 was measured in CD8+ T cells of patients with active disease (n=5) by cytofluorometry and compared with expression in patients in remission (n=80) and in age-matched healthy donors (n=34). The results were compared to clinical parameters including severity and duration of the disease. CD8+CD57+ were detected in patients with WG and MPA and in healthy donors as well and increased considerably with age. Compared to age-matched healthy donors, the prevalence of CD8+CD57+ was increased in the younger patients (up to 40 y). In most patients a high percentage of CD8+CD57+ coincided with severe disease and multiple organ involvement, while low CD8+CD57+ percentage was seen in patients with limited disease or in patients in complete remission. In patients with smoldering disease, the percentage of CD8+CD57+ increased with time. High numbers of CD8+CD57+ correlated with low CD4:CD8 ratio. In patients with WG and MPA a population of CD8+CD57+ expand, identifying terminally differentiated CD8+ cells. The prevalence of CD57+ cells was related to the course of disease. So far, the function of CD57 on CD8+ cells is not understood. However, these cells might produce certain cytokines, which play a role in the pathogenesis of AAV. The data support the hypothesis that CD8+ T cells are activated in the context of primary vasculitides.
