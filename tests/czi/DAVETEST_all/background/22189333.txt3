The verification of effectiveness of home medical care workshop for hospital nurses: the result was based on before/after questionnaire survey
Since 2006, the department of home nursing care at Tokyo Women's Medical University Hospital has held a half year long 6-courses home medical care workshop for our hospital nurses by inviting local medical and welfare specialists as their lecturers. The objective of the workshop was to gain a wider range of knowledge and understanding of hospital discharge support system and home medical care services. In order to evaluate the level of understanding and achievement obtained from the workshop, a questionnaire survey was conducted in 2010 asking the participants to fill out a self evaluation form before and after the course. In addition to that, a class evaluation form was handed out after each class to evaluate a level of understanding of each lecture. The result showed that all aspect of the evaluation levels went up(p 0. 05). Some of the free comments were summarized in the followings: 1 ) Positive results were obtained by working together, and we learned how to coordinate with the regional medical specialists through specific case studies. 2 ) It was a good opportunity for the nurses to receive a direct advice from facilitators(visiting nurses)on cases at hand. 3 ) The lectures' talks based on their experiences brought us a feeling of closeness in the regional home medical care. After the course was concluded, the following issues were raised by hospital ward nurses in the area of difficulties at the time of patient's discharge from the hospital: 1 ) The coordination between doctors and other medical specialists, 2 ) Handling of different requirements among the different family members, 3 ) Timing of patient discharge planning, and 4 ) Lack of knowledge in social resources and medical health insurance system. Hence, we would like to incorporate these survey findings.
