Prosthetic hip infection due to Listeria monocytogenes: review of the literature and case report
With the ageing of the population, articular prosthetic replacements are becoming more and more frequent. One of the most feared complications is prosthetic infection, mostly due to bacteria of the cutaneous flora. Listeria monocytogenes is rarely the cause. This paper describes the management of a hip prosthetic infection due to Listeria monocytogenes. The patient was cured with antimicrobial therapy and a two-stage exchange. This case report creates an opportunity to review the literature in the aim of determining the risk factors and the optimal care.
