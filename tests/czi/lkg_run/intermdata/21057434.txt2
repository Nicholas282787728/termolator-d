Alternative work and world. Chronicity of emergencies and the work in crisis unit
We describe the legal framework within which we carry out consultations, otherwise called expertises, with view to considering involuntary admissions to hospital for the treatment of mental illness (here called confinements). We note that in our area only 40% of consultations lead to involuntary admissions to hospital, and we believe that this number is related to our consideration of alternative methods of care in the community. We suggest a multi-centric study to evaluate what specific skills are required to properly carry out these assessments and to establish the extent to which the increased workload of assessments is influencing the rate of involuntary admissions.
