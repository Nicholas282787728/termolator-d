Equity in access to treatment for breast cancer in Colombia
To evaluate equity in access by comparing geographic, economic, and organizational barriers as well as authorization obstacles that women encounter depending on their affiliation with the social security health system. A retrospective survey was conducted among women undergoing breast cancer treatment to determine differences and the degree of fairness in access to care according to their affiliation with the social security health system. Women affiliated with the subsidized social security health system as well as women living in rural areas have a greater probability to travel to another city (OR 2.40 IC95%;1.64-3.43 and OR 1.80 IC95%;1.04-3.06, respectively). Poor women without insurance have greater probability of having to pay for medications (OR 3.7 IC95%;2.15-6.44). Access to breast cancer treatment is inequitable and particularly detrimental to vulnerable populations.
