Glycobiology of the cell surface: Its debt to cell electrophoresis 1940-65
This Review describes how in the period 1940-1959 cell electrophoresis (in the earlier literature often referred to as 'microelectrophoresis') was used to explore the surface chemistry of cells. Using the erythrocyte as a suitable model for the study of biological membranes, the early investigators were agreed on the presence of negatively charged groups at the surface of this cell. The contemporary dogma was that these were phosphate groups associated with phospholipids. Work in the 1960s, particularly on changes in the electrokinetic properties of erythrocytes following treatment with proteolytic enzymes, lead to the realization that the negatively charged groups at the red cell surface are predominantly due to sialic acids carried on glycoproteins. It quickly became apparent from cell electrophoresis that sialic acids have a ubiquitous presence on the surface of animal cells. This finding required that any complete model of the plasma membrane must include glycosylated molecules at the cell periphery, thus laying the foundations for the field termed 'Glycobiology of the Cell Surface'.
