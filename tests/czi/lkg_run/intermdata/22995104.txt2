Symetis ACURATE TA valve
The transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis ACURATE TA (Symetis SA, Ecublens, Switzerland) has been specifically designed for transapical access with a future transfemoral version under development. The concept relies on a self-expandable nitinol stent housing a regular porcine bioprosthesis. A unique two-step implantation technique facilitates intuitive positioning. Two pre-approval multicentre trials have demonstrated promising results especially as regards a low rate of paravalvular leaks. The device obtained CE mark at the end of 2011 and is currently commercially available in Europe. This manuscript focuses on the technical details of this new transapical TAVI device and its specific implantation technique.
