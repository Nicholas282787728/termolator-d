Analysis of serum cytokine levels in larynx squamous cell carcinoma and dysplasia patients
Although the imbalance of cytokines in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) is well known, there is scarce data regarding its occurrence during dysplasia, before the malignant transformation. To determine whether laryngeal dysplasia patients show a different cytokine profile than patients with cancer and healthy controls. Seventeen newly diagnosed, untreated larynx squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and six laryngeal dysplasia patients as well as 22 healthy controls were analyzed for circulating cytokines. A flowcytometry Th1/Th2 cytokine array kit was used to quantitatively measure Interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) and Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels. Additionally, IL-8 levels were determined through ELISA. IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 were determined to be statistically increased in SCC patients (p<0.05). IL-8 and IL-10 levels were also higher in SCC patients than dysplasia patients (p<0.05). Additionally, IL-6 and IL-10 were all found to be markedly increased in dysplasia patients compared with controls (p<0.05). Our results demonstrate an imbalance of IL-6 and IL-10 not only in HNSCC but also in laryngeal dysplasia.
