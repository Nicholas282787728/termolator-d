Beyond the clinic: importance of community involvement in sodium-reduction efforts
Excessive sodium intake is a serious public health problem that is amenable to intervention. Despite campaigns that often target individuals to encourage lower sodium intake, consumption is far in excess of recommendations. There is increasing recognition of the importance of the food environment in shaping dietary behavior and the need for strategies that focus on changing community-level environmental factors that support a shift in behavior toward more healthful eating. Practice-based evidence should be coupled with evidence from well-conducted clinical studies of sodium and health to build the foundation for public health interventions that achieve and sustain sodium reduction in the general population. This article discusses the importance of moving beyond the clinic and engaging communities in this important public health effort.
