Developing and implementing an effective framework for collaboration: the experience of the CS2day collaborative
Organizations from varied sectors have pursued collaboration to better fulfill their missions, facilitate decision making, solve more complex problems, and respond more rapidly to a changing environment. While these benefits are evident through the products and services provided, few organizations evaluate the factors that contribute to the success or failure of the collaboration itself. The CS2day Collaborative was formed by 9 separate organizations with a common goal of increasing smoking quit rates through health care professional education. To better understand the factors that influence successful collaboration, the authors applied criteria established by the Wilder Foundation to the functioning of this health care education collaborative. Factors analyzed include the influence of the environment, membership, process and structure, communication, purpose, and resources. Factors relevant to continuing medical education/continuing professional development (CME/CPD) including accreditation, conflict of interest resolution and management, guideline dissemination, continuous assessment and interprofessional education influenced the collaborative structure. Specific examples provided illustrate how diverse organizations can work together effectively to address a public health need. While the CS2day Collaborative was not formed with prior knowledge of these factors, they provide a useful framework for examining how this collaborative was developed and has operated.
