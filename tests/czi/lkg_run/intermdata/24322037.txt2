Non-keratinizing undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is the predominant tumor type arising in the nasopharynx with cervical lymph nodes present in 60-90% of all cases at the time of presentation. The most frequent pathological varieties include squamous cell carcinoma well-differentiated keratinizing, moderately differentiated non-keratinizing and an undifferentiated type. We present a case of non-keratinizing undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx with parapharyngeal and middle cranial fossa space involvement in an 18-year-old male who has been admitted in our hospital for recurrent right ear otitis media. Symptoms consisted in mild conductive hearing loss, trigeminal V2 nerve anesthesia, right ear tinnitus, mild dysphagia, mild dysphonia, right hypoglossal nerve paralysis and right Claude Bernard-Horner's syndrome. Clinical examination revealed no lymph node masses, chest X-ray corresponding to a normal thoracic image. Cranial contrast enhanced CT scan showed a non-homogenous mass of 5.4/4.5/5.5 cm from the level of the right rhinopharyngeal wall, extending in the right parapharyngeal space, invading the right middle cranial fossa. Cranial MRI with contrast enhancement revealed a rhino- and parapharyngeal mass of 5.5/4.6/5.3 cm with intracerebral extension in the right cavernous sinus, right internal carotid artery being engulfed by the tumor mass with partial compression. Several lymph node masses of 1.7/1.2 cm were also revealed. We performed rhinopharyngeal biopsy, right tympanotomy and grommet tube insertion. The tissue specimens were processed with routine histological technique. Subsequent immunohistochemical reactions for pan-cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and leukocytes common antigen were performed. The histological examination of routine stained slides showed that malignant tumor cells had a syncytial pattern of growth in a background of small lymphocytes. The positivity of tumor cells for pan-cytokeratin established the final diagnosis of non-keratinizing undifferentiated carcinoma. The age of onset, the clinical signs and symptoms and minimum involvement of lymph nodes represents the particular aspects of the case.
