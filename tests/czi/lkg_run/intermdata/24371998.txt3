Diagnosis and therapy of atherosclerosis through molecular biological approaches possibility of HDL-targeting therapy by manipulation of micro RNA-33
Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) increase the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), and statin therapy to decrease LDL-C significantly reduces the risk of cardiovascular events. Despite the effectiveness of statin therapy, there remains a significant residual cardiovascular risk. A low plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is associated with an increased risk of CHD. However, recent clinical trials aimed at reducing the CHD risk by raising HDL-C levels have not shown satisfactory results, and it is becoming evident that a functional HDL-C is a more desirable target than simply elevating its level. This review summarizes the function of HDL-C in reverse cholesterol transfer from peripheral tissue and discusses the latest HDL-targeting therapeutic strategies including the manipulation of microRNAs.
