Short communication: Graph for calculating maximum local analgesic dose in millilitres for the paediatric population
Determination of the maximum local analgesic dosage in millilitres can be confusing. This article presents a new graph that easily allows the dental practitioner to determine a child's maximum local analgesic dosage in millilitres based on their weight. Local analgesia is used daily in dentistry to manage pain, and different kinds of agents are available in the market that may be selected depending on the strength and duration of analgesia required. Each analgesic agent has a maximum recommended dose, and it is very important to calculate that dose, especially in children, to avoid the risk of toxicity that could lead to death. Currently a series of calculations are used to calculate the maximum recommended dose for local analgesic agents that could be taxing. This paper presents a newly-developed graph that makes it easier for dental practitioners to quickly identify the maximum recommended dose of the different local analgesic agents used in dentistry based on a patient's weight. Dentists can utilize this graph to obtain the maximum local analgesic dose in millilitres based on the child's weight. This will save time and encourage dentists to routinely identify the maximum allowed dose and most importantly, decrease or eliminate the risks of toxicity and overdose especially when treating small children.
