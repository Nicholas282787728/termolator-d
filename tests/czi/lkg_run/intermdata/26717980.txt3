HIV stigma intervention in a low-HIV prevalence setting: a pilot study in an Egyptian healthcare facility
This pilot study is the first to evaluate stigma-reduction intervention in a healthcare setting in Egypt and in the Middle East and North Africa region. It also contributes to knowledge on how to address stigma in low-HIV prevalence settings. A quasi-experimental study design was used to evaluate the effect of anti-HIV stigma intervention in one hospital in Egypt. A control hospital was selected and matched to the intervention hospital by type, size and location. The intervention focused on HIV-related stigma, infection control and medical ethics. Stigma was measured at baseline and at three months post-intervention. A standardized, 10-point scale was developed to measure stigmatizing attitudes and fear-based stigma among participants. Comparisons of overall and job-stratified stigma scores were made across the intervention and control hospitals, before and after the intervention, using two-sample t-test and multivariate regression analysis. Mean stigma scores did not reveal significant differences between the intervention and control hospitals at baseline. After intervention, the overall value-based and fear-based stigma scores were significantly lower in the intervention hospital compared to the control hospital (2.1 and 1.1 compared to 3.8 and 3.2, respectively; p   .001). Context-specific and culturally appropriate HIV stigma-reduction interventions in low-HIV prevalence settings can reduce fear-based and value-based stigma among physicians and nurses.
