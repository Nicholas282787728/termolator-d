Efficacy of 595nm pulsed dye laser therapy for Mibelli angiokeratoma
To retrospectively study the clinical efficacy of 595nm pulsed dye laser therapy for Mibelli angiokeratoma. 50 cases of Mibelli angiokeratoma, from 10 to 41 year-oldï¼Œwere treated with the 595nm pulsed dye laser. The parameters were as follows: a wavelength of 595 nm, pulse duration of 10ms, spot size of 7 mm and energy fluency of 12.0-13.5 J/cm(2). The treatments were repeated at intervals of 4-6 weeks until the lesion was cleared, or the parents discontinued the treatment. Detailed demographics and the assessment of the degree of lesion clearance were statistically analyzed through SASS18.0. All the 50 patients were treated 1-4 times. The total rate of significant improvement was 80%, and the rate of full recovery was 30%. We failed to find statistical significance between genders, or the size and color of lesions, which might be due to limited sample size. The most common adverse effects after treatment were purpura and edema, which usually lasted for 12 h to several days. Temporary pigment alterations were not common. Other side effects such as scar or skin texture change were not observed. Our experience confirmed the clinical efficacy and safety of the 595 nm pulse dye laser in the treatment of Mibelli angiokeratoma.
