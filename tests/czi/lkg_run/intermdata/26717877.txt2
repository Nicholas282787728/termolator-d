Galectin-9 suppresses the proliferation of gastric cancer cells in vitro
Gastric cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and the prognosis of advanced gastric cancer remains poor. Galectin-9 (Gal-9) is a tandem-repeat-type galectin that has recently been demonstrated to exert anti-proliferative effects on various types of cancer cells. The aim of our present study was to evaluate the effects of Gal-9 on human gastric cancer cells and the expression levels of microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with the antitumor effects of Gal-9 in vitro. In our initial experiments, Gal-9 suppressed the proliferation of gastric cancer cell lines in vitro. Our data further revealed that Gal-9 increased caspase-cleaved keratin 18 (CCK18) levels in gastric cancer cells. Additionally, Gal-9 reduced the phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Furthermore, miRNA expression levels were markedly altered with Gal-9 treatment in vitro. In conclusion, Gal-9 suppressed the proliferation of human gastric cancer cells by inducing apoptosis. These findings suggest that Gal-9 could be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of gastric cancer.
