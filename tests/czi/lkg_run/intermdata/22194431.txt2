International practices of organ donation
Organ donation and transplant rates vary widely across the globe, but there remains an almost universal shortage of deceased donors. The unmet need for transplants has resulted in many systematic approaches to increase donor rates, but there have also been practices that have crossed the boundaries of legal and ethical acceptability. Recent years have seen intense interest from international political organizations, led by the World Health Organization, and professional bodies, led by The Transplantation Society. Their efforts have focused on the development of a series of legal and ethical frameworks, designed to encourage all countries to eradicate unacceptable practices while introducing programmes that strive to achieve national or regional self-sufficiency in meeting the need for organ transplants. These programmes should seek to reduce both the need for transplantation and also develop deceased donation to its maximum potential. Living donation remains the mainstay of transplantation in many parts of the world, and many of the controversial--and unacceptable--areas of practice are found in the exploitation of living donors. However, until lessons are learnt, and applied, from countries with highly developed deceased donor programmes, these abuses of human rights will be difficult to eradicate. A clear international framework is now in place to achieve this.
