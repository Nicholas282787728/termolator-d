Accreditation and the use of validated/recognised methods to analyse human semen
Accreditation of laboratories who perform diagnostic semen analysis in Australia and New Zealand is a requirement of the healthcare system. Within the accreditation process laboratories are required to set ISO standards within their policies and procedures. In order to achieve their aims, laboratories need to be able to measure a number of defined semen parameters both accurately and repetitively, especially around the lower limit of the reference intervals. The methods documented in the WHO-manual are used almost universal as the laboratory standard. Some laboratories incorporate minor method variations into their procedures. As part of the ISO requirements all variations require validation using internally approved processes that are documented and that incorporate appropriate statistical analysis and comparison of results. Validation is an ongoing process and regular review is essential. Evidence of the validation must be available for review by external auditors during accreditation. Where any validated variant method returns results that are significantly different to any method within the WHO-manual, the laboratory needs to develop its own, in-house reference interval for that method.
