Melodic Intonation Therapy: present controversies and future opportunities
This article describes the state of the art of Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT), a structured aphasia therapy program using the melodic aspects of language (intonation, rhythm, and stress) to improve language production. MIT was developed in the 1970s and is still used worldwide. Nevertheless, we argue that many questions crucial for the clinical application of MIT are still unanswered. First, a review of MIT effect studies is presented showing that evidence from well-designed group studies is still lacking. It is also unclear which aspects of MIT contribute most to its therapeutic effect and which underlying neural mechanisms are involved. Two cases are presented illustrating unsolved questions concerning MIT in clinical practice, such as candidacy and the best timing of this therapy.
