Vegetative nervous system state in vibration disease and chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy in miners
Clinical and functional studies helped to assess influence of vegetative nervous system on course of vibration disease and chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy in miners. Vegetative dysfunction syndrome varying in intensity was associated with simultaneous overstrain in segmentary and supersegmentary units of vegetative nervous system. The authors defined dependence between vegetative dysfunction intensity and neuromuscular disorders severity. With this, increased threshold of N-reflex with lower amplitude accompanied decrease in M-response amplitude and shorter latent period, in accordance with peripheral nerve impulse speed. The dependence between vegetative nervous system strain and neuromuscular disorders intensity underlies pain syndrome degree in vibration disease and chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy in miners.
