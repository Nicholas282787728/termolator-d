Eyelid benign and malignant tumors: issues in classification, excision and reconstruction
In the orbital region the variety of tumors is so vast that even an expert oculoplastic surgeon may be deceived. The various tumors may be classified as benign, precancerous and malignant. Approximately 5-10% of all skin cancers occur in the eyelids. Incidence studies indicate that basal cell carcinoma is the most frequent malignant eyelid tumor, followed by squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Malignant neoplasms represent the leading cause of plastic reconstruction in orbital region, followed by cicatricial retraction, post-traumatic loss of tissue, congenital colobomas. Aim of this review is to classify benign and malignant lesions; to consider the surgical removal approach to the lesion (Mohs micrographic surgery, frozen sections, biopsy, immediate removal and reconstruction with permanent sections) and finally to consider reconstruction techniques with grafts and flaps.
