St Jude Medical Portico valve
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is increasingly being used to treat high-risk patients with symptomatic aortic valve disease. However, challenges still remain with current devices, both in terms of the procedure and the outcome. The St Jude Medical Portico transcatheter valve system is designed to mitigate some of these difficulties. We describe the device characteristics and how the device may impact on a TAVI procedure. An overview of the clinical experiences with the Portico valve system is also described.
