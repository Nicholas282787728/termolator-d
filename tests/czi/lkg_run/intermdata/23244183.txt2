Image-guided percutaneous transthoracic biopsy in lung cancer--emphasis on CT-guided technique
Image-guided percutaneous transthoracic core biopsy especially with CT guidance is playing an increasing role in the diagnosis and management of lung cancer. The recent advances in the specific chemotherapy and novel targeted therapy and the increasing need for specific diagnosis of tumor histopathologic subtypes have direct impact on the radiologists performing lung biopsy and important implications for the biopsy technique. Close cooperation between radiologists and referring physicians with understanding of the technical aspects of the biopsy procedure can help clinicians make appropriate referrals for this procedure and understand the significance and limitations of the results. Additionally, the appropriate management of complications can limit morbidity related to the biopsy procedure.
