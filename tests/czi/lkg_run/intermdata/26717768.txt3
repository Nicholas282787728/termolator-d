The Progress in Remote Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy
As a kind of spectroscopic technique, the remote laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (Remote LIBS) can measure elemental compositions of remote targets by using high-power lasers and focusing approaches. In this paper, three remote detection approaches (open path LIBS, fiber optic LIBS and compact probe fiber optic LIBS) and their system architectures are summarized and analyzed. Conventional open path LIBS, with high requirement of specifications of lasers, optical systems, spectrographs and detectors, has always been a research focus in remote testing field. Fiber optic LIBS has the advantages of simplification of optical focusing system and high collection efficiency of the plasma light. This paper reviews the progress in new techniques of LIBS, for instance Filament-LIBS techniques and LIBS combines with other spectral detection techniques, and emphatically analyzes their characteristics and advantages. These new techniques have greatly broadened the detection range of LIBS, enhanced material recognition ability of LIBS, and made a great contribution to expanding applications of remote LIBS. Latest development of applications of remote LIBS in fields of deep space exploration, hazardous material detection, pollution testing, metallurgical industries and heritage restoration is introduced in detail. With the development of laser techniques, spectral detection and calibration techniques, the detection range of remote LIBS has been expended, their application fields has been extended, and the detection precision and accuracy have been improved.
