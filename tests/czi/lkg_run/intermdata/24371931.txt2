The Community Development Progress and Evaluation Tool: Assessing community development fieldwork
Both the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists (CAOT) and World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT) fieldwork guidelines promote fieldwork experiences that build community capacity. Yet, no existing tool that assesses the unique skills of community development fieldwork could be identified within or outside of occupational therapy. This article describes the development of the Community Development Progress and Evaluation Tool (CD-PET), an assessment of community development fieldwork in occupational therapy. TOOL DEVELOPMENT: The CD-PET was developed in five distinct phases: (a) literature review, (b) identification of a theoretical framework, (c) tool construction, (d) pilot testing, and (e) ongoing refinement. Focus groups yielded input from preceptors and students. Once developed, the assessment was pilot tested with feedback received through an online survey completed by preceptors and students. Key enablement skills identified in Enabling Occupation II provided the foundation for the tool. The CD-PET is a student assessment and learning tool for occupational therapy students and preceptors that supports learning in the key enablement skills that are used in community development fieldwork.
