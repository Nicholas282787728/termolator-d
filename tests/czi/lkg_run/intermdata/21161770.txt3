When the road is full of potholes, I wonder why they are bringing condoms? Social spaces for understanding young Papua New Guineans' health-related knowledge and health-promoting action
As in many other parts of the world, young people in Papua New Guinea (PNG) are considered particularly vulnerable to HIV infection. Young Papua New Guineans' understanding of health and HIV form the basis of their interactions with HIV-prevention programmes, yet literature documenting their views is limited. Participatory research was conducted with 31 youth in two different settings in the Highlands of PNG to analyse their perceptions of factors influencing young people's health in a local context. The participants perceived social and structural factors to have a dominant influence on their health outcomes, in contrast to prevention programmes' focus on individuals. Youth perceived HIV to be less pressing than other everyday health concerns not currently addressed by national programmes, with their resultant frustration undermining the potential of existing HIV-prevention interventions. The young participants' experience of the social spaces developed through Photovoice, the research approach used, demonstrates the potential and limitations of participatory initiatives to support young people's actions to reduce their vulnerability to poor health outcomes. Findings point to the importance of youth-focused intervention programmes engaging influential adults in a community, and supporting in-between spaces where young people and community leaders can connect in order to affect the health-related contexts in which young people live.
