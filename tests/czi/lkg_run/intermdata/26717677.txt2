Temporal and Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Dissolved Organic Matter and Influencing Factors in Lake Chaohu
To study the temporal and spatial distribution of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the related influencing factors of Lake Chaohu, surface water samples were collected at seventeen sites in three different regions of the Lake from April 2013 to April 2014. The concentration of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were then analyzed. A significance difference in DON concentration was observed among the sampling sites (P <0. 01, n = 13), which was caused by the terrestrial input from the western rivers and the bioavailability of DON. The ratio of total nitrogen to total phosphorus, total dissolved nitrogen to total dissolved phosphorus, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen to soluble reactive phosphorus (DIN/SRP) declined gradually during the phytoplankton bloom period, especially the ratio of DIN/SRP dropped to 5 Â± 7 in August 2013, indicating the nitrogen was limited in lake water. Moreover, the concentration of DON was decreased and a significant negative correlation was observed between DON and Chl-a (r = - 0. 265, P < 0. 05, n = 91), suggesting that DON is bioavailable, and can be utilized by phytoplankton directly or indirectly during nitrogen limitation. No significant difference in DOC concentration was observed and water temperature was the major factor related to the variation of DOC. Chl-a and nitrate concentrations can also affect the dynamics of DOC. In addition, the ratio of DOC/DON was considerably varied, the concentration of DON contributed to the variation of DOC/DON, and DON was the major component contributed to the bioavailability of DOM.
