Midwifery in Somaliland
During the civil war in Somaliland (1982-1991), health facilities were devastated and many healthcare workers were killed or became refugees. Since then the country has struggled to rebuild hospitals and health centres and increase the number of healthcare professionals. Many non government officers from a variety of countries are assisting throughout the country. In 2011 I accepted a post establishing the first BSc in midwifery in Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland. I was employed by Tropical Health Education Trust (THET) in conjunction with Edna Adan University hospital. The students were to be nurse-midwives; the hope was that they would go on to become the movers and shakers in Somaliland. Little did I know how big the challenge would be.
