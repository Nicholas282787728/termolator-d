Application of basic research to development of diagnostics and therapeutic agents against inflammatory diseases
Biomarkers are generally important for the treatment of patients from the points of diagnosis of disease, assessment of cure, assessment of prognosis such as metastasis or recurrence, prevention of disease, and prediction of drug efficacy. Currently it is well accepted that allergic diseases such as bronchial asthma and atopic dermatitis are not single diseases, but syndromes encompassing different diseases entities. Therefore, it is important to cluster allergic disease patients to assess prognosis or the choice of therapeutic drugs, and useful biomarkers are required for these purposes. Periostin, an extracellular matrix protein, has recently emerged as a biomarker useful for clustering asthma patients. We further found that periostin plays an important role in allergic inflammation and based on this finding we are now developing therapeutic agents targeting periostin against allergic diseases. Since periostin is involved in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory diseases in addition to allergic diseases, such diagnostics and therapeutic agents can be applied to many inflammatory diseases. In this article, we describe the history of periostin research and our application of basic research to the development of diagnostics and therapeutic agents against inflammatory diseases.
