Scoliosis nonfusion--a reality check
Nonfusion growing instrumentation is currently an important aspect of early onset scoliosis management and newer technologies to treat scoliosis without fusion hold the exciting promise of a new paradigm in spinal deformity care. Some of these technologies such as growing constructs have a sufficient track record for preliminary conclusions particularly about complications. Others, such as growth modification devices, still have limited human experience and clinical series comparing them to the natural history are essential before they become a part of standard practice. While the ideas and basic science are exciting, quality studies are needed to determine their actual role in practice.
