Self-Reported Physical Activity Among American Indian Adults From Two Diverse Regions
Physical activity may be a protective factor against the disproportionate rates of chronic diseases faced by American Indians. Nevertheless, few studies report any cultural adoptions made to capture physical activity behaviors among this hard-to-reach population. Existing studies reporting the prevalence of physical activity among American Indians are often aggregated and tend to obscure regional, local, and tribal-level variations. This study examines the prevalence of physical activity and inactivity levels, along with associated factors, among rural dwelling American Indian adults from 2 distinct regions. Baseline self-reported data were collected using a culturally modified version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form during the Obesity Research Prevention and Evaluation of Intervention Effectiveness in Native North Americans trial (OPREVENT) among rural American Indian adults (aged 18-75 years) from 5 tribal communities in Michigan and New Mexico. Most participants were classified as moderately physically active (43.5%), and the majority reported access to physical activity facilities (83.5%). Michigan participants reported engaging in more moderate and total physical activity than those in New Mexico (P < .001) and reported spending less time sitting (P < .001). Differences in physical activity among the American Indian communities may be due to regional variations in occupations, climate, and tribal and community support and infrastructure. The unexpected high level of activity evokes uncertainty in the accuracy and appropriateness of the data collection instrument. Research is needed to understand culturally appropriate approaches to measure physical activity and inactivity among rural American Indians.
