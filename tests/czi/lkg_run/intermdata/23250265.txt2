Cultural adaptation and validation of the Underwood's Daily Spiritual Experience Scale--Brazilian version
This study aimed to perform the cultural adaptation and analyzing the psychometric properties of the Brazilian version of the Underwood's Daily Spiritual Experience Scale (DSES). The adaptation followed the internationally recommended procedures and the adapted version maintained equivalence to the original after wording adjustments in five items. In the application to 179 medical-surgical patients it was found evidences of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.91), test-retest reliability (ICC=0.94) and convergent validity, correlating with the Intrinsic Religiosity subscale of the Duke Religious Index DUREL (r=0.56, p<0.001). Exploratory factor analysis extracted three principal components explaining 60.5% of the total variance. The DSES-Brazilian version shows evidences of reliability and validity among hospitalized patients. Further studies are needed to confirm its factor composition and to test its applicability in different populations.
