Ruthenium-catalyzed reductive amination without an external hydrogen source
A ruthenium-catalyzed reductive amination without an external hydrogen source has been developed using carbon monoxide as the reductant and ruthenium(III) chloride (0.008-2 mol %) as the catalyst. The method was applied to the synthesis of antianxiety agent ladasten.
