Synchronous ossifying fibromas of the jaws: a review
According to the World Health Organization, it is proposed that benign fibro-osseous lesions be divided into 3 categories, including fibrous dysplasia, ossifying fibroma (OF), and osseous dysplasia. OF arises from the periodontal ligament, which contains multipotential cells. These benign tumors may become large and aggressive. Slow growth and lack of symptoms are the cardinal features. OF tends to occur in the second and third decades of life, with predilection for women and for the mandibular premolar-molar area. The method of treatment used for large or rapidly expanding lesions is surgical removal (enucleation). Rarely, OFs occur multifocally. We report a 20-year-old man with synchronous OFs of his maxilla and mandible and review other synchronous cases reported. Such lesions can be properly diagnosed and treated by correlating radiographic, clinical, surgical, and histopathologic findings.
