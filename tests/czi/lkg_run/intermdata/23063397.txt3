Tissue engineering of human oral mucosa on different scaffolds: in vitro experiments as a basis for clinical applications
The lack of oral mucosa in oral and maxillofacial surgery for intraoral grafting after trauma or tumor resection can be balanced by tissue-engineered oral mucosa. The aim of this study was to generate a tissue-engineered oral mucosa equivalent (OME). First, primary oral fibroblasts were cultured for 7 days on different materials: Tissufoil E (TFE), dermal regeneration template (DRT), and Vicryl. Then, cocultures were established by seeding of primary oral keratinocytes and culturing for another 7-14 days. Immunohistochemical staining for CD90, cytokeratin 14 and collagen IV as well as gene expression analysis using reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to get information about cell architecture and basal membrane formation. Vicryl showed good mechanical stability but mixed cell growth. TFE provided the best cell growth with good cell architecture and basal membrane formation but showed degradation. The best results for the above-mentioned criteria were seen with DRT. It was possible to create OMEs on all 3 scaffolds. The arrangement of the cells strongly depends on the texture of the material.
