Alveolar ridge augmentation for implant fixation: status review
This literature review was performed to illustrate and compare different alveolar ridge augmentation procedures before dental implant placement. The review was based on clinical and research studies listed in Pubmed. There is not enough evidence to support any single method as gold standard for any given condition, and choice seemed to be based on personal preferences. There is a lack of long-term survival data or success rates of grafting materials regarding donor and recipient sites. Although ridge splitting and distraction osteogenesis techniques eliminate donor site morbidity, circumvent the use of grafting materials, and reduce the operation time, some disadvantages and limitations should be considered. More studies are needed to compare the fate and characteristics of new bone obtained by these different procedures, as well as subsequent implant survival rates.
