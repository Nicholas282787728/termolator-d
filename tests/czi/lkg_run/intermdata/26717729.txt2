The High Precision Analysis Research of Multichannel BOTDR Scattering Spectral Information Based on the TTDF and CNS Algorithm
Traditional BOTDR optical fiber sensing system uses single channel sensing fiber to measure the information features. Uncontrolled factors such as cross-sensitivity can lead to a lower scattering spectrum fitting precision and make the information analysis deflection get worse. Therefore, a BOTDR system for detecting the multichannel sensor information at the same time is proposed. Also it provides a scattering spectrum analysis method for multichannel Brillouin optical time-domain reflection (BOT-DR) sensing system in order to extract high precision spectrum feature. This method combines the three times data fusion (TTDF) and the cuckoo Newton search (CNS) algorithm. First, according to the rule of Dixon and Grubbs criteria, the method uses the ability of TTDF algorithm in data fusion to eliminate the influence of abnormal value and reduce the error signal. Second, it uses the Cuckoo Newton search algorithm to improve the spectrum fitting and enhance the accuracy of Brillouin scattering spectrum information analysis. We can obtain the global optimal solution by smart cuckoo search. By using the optimal solution as the initial value of Newton algorithm for local optimization, it can ensure the spectrum fitting precision. The information extraction at different linewidths is analyzed in temperature information scattering spectrum under the condition of linear weight ratio of 1:9. The variances of the multichannel data fusion is about 0.0030, the center frequency of scattering spectrum is 11.213 GHz and the temperature error is less than 0.15 K. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the algorithm can be used in multichannel distributed optical fiber sensing system based on Brillouin optical time domain reflection. It can improve the accuracy of multichannel sensing signals and the precision of Brillouin scattering spectrum analysis effectively.
