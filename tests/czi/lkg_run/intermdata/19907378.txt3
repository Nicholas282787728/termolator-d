Predictive validity of the mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (mcex): do medical students' mCEX ratings correlate with future clinical exam performance?
The degree to which scores on the mini-Clinical Evaluation Exercise (mCEX), a feedback tool, correlate with performance on future clinical skills examinations is unknown. Medicine clerkship students in 2006 and 2007 completed eight mCEX cards and took an end-of-clerkship standardized patient (SP) exam and an end-of-year multidisciplinary SP exam. Pearson correlations estimated relationships between average mCEX scores and scores on the SP exams. A total of 244 students met inclusion requirements. Observed correlations between mCEX performance and SP checklist/notes and interpersonal skills scores ranged from 0.15 to 0.39. Disattenuated estimates were 0.21 to 0.50. This is one of the first studies comparing mCEX and SP exam performance. Explanations for the generally modest correlations merit further consideration.
