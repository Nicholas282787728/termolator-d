Optical Properties Investigation of p-Type ZnO Film Based on Doping by Diffusion
The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the optical properties of p-type ZnO film based on P doping. ZnO film was grown by Atomic layer deposition (ALD) on InP subsrate in this experiment, and phosphorus diffused into ZnO lattice by annealing treatment at different temperature (500, 700 ⁰C). The optical properties of samples were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, which indicated that the annealing temperature is the important factor influencing the phosphorus diffusion doping. The low-temperature PL spectra of the sample which annealed at 700 ⁰C for 1 h exhibited acceptor related emission peaks located at 3.351, 3.311, 3.246 and 3.177 eV, which were attributed to A ⁰X, FA, DAP and DA-1LO, respectively. The acceptor binding energy is estimated to be about 122 meV, which is agreed with the theoretic values in phosphorus-doped ZnO films. In this paper, through thermal diffusion method to realize the p-type doped ZnO thin films, it solved the main problems which limited the development of ZnO based optoelectronic devices, and has an important significance for the development of the ZnO semiconductor materials and ZnO based photoelectric device.
