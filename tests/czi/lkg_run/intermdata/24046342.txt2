The intersection of education and technology at the century mark
Since the inception of dental hygiene in 1913, we have witnessed the tremendous evolution of the profession. Within the past couple two decades a significant game changer has been technology. The ability to expand access to education through technology has resulted in an increasing number of dental hygienists seeking advanced degrees and gaining new skills and certifications. The evidence shows that dental hygienists are using their advanced education to address lack of access to oral health care services. The profession should remain focused on advocating for the increased education of the dental hygienist, by finding solutions to barriers that presently prevent the realization of this ultimate advancement.
