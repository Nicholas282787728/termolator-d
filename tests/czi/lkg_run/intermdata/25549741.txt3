A regional approach to the education of nurse practitioner candidates to meet the health needs of rural Australians
Abstract Background: Local health services expressed interest in supporting a nurse practitioner (NP) program specifically designed for rural practice environments. To develop and deliver a generalist NP program that prepares candidates for practice in rural contexts. The Master of Clinical Nursing (Nurse Practitioner) program was designed with an understanding of the burden of disease impacting on rural Australians, application of the national health priorities, the Australian Government's refocus on preventative health care and rural health workforce shortages. This program offers nurses who work in rural and remote settings an opportunity to advance their careers. Increasing the numbers of rural NPs will improve rural populations access to healthcare and potentially improve health outcomes. This program will equip those seeking endorsement as a NP to effectively work in rural contexts.
