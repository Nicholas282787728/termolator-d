The roles of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in the management of lung cancer
Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important treatment option for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These targeted therapies have been studied extensively in NSCLC in first line and subsequent lines, including maintenance in empiric fashion or in patients with tumors harboring the EGFR mutations. In this manuscript, we will review in details the evolutions of these targeted therapy in the management of NSCLC.
