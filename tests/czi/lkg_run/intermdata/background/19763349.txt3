Out-patients haemophilia treatment in hospital: status quo of the legal basis for care-agreements
Although hospitals primarily provide treatment for in-patients, treatment is also given to a large number of out-patients. The law covering haemophilia patients, who receive their treatment as out-patients, actually has several different bases. This has advantages and disadvantages. The question concerning us: Which, at the moment, is the best legal basis for any care-agreement? Another important factor for any agreement between the two parties, is that there should be a broad consensus, based on shared interests. The common aim should be the future guarantee for the treatment of patients suffering from haemophilia in suitable medical facilities. At the same time care must be taken to provide an efficient and economically viable care-service for these patients, as well as ensuring that the quality and efficiency of the service remain transparent.
