Composite tissue allotransplantation
Recently, composite tissue allotransplantation was introduced as a potential clinical treatment for complex reconstructive procedures, including tumor ablative operations, traumatic injuries, and extensive tissue loss secondary to burns. Composite tissue allotransplantations consist of heterogeneous tissues including skin, fat, muscle, nerves, lymph nodes, bone, cartilage, ligaments, and bone marrow, all presenting with different antigenicity. Thus, composite tissue allotransplantations are considered to elicit a stronger response compared with solid organ transplants. This article outlines different experimental models and current clinical applications of composite tissue allotransplantation.
