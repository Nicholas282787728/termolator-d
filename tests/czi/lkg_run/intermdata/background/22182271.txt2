Carotid artery stenting for primary and secondary stroke prevention
Carotid artery disease is a major cause of the disability and mortality associated with strokes. Ischemic stroke remains the major cause of adult disability and third-leading cause of adult mortality, and carotid revascularization currently remains the principal surgical tool in the prophylaxis of this disease. The literature representing the current body of evidence for carotid revascularization and the authors' current practices in the management of this disease are summarized in this review. We provide an evidence-based narration of the development and current status of carotid artery stenting (CAS) by reviewing 1) the evidence for carotid revascularization from early carotid endarterectomy (CEA) trials; 2) the randomized trials comparing CEA and CAS, with a special emphasis on the recently published results of the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST), which have been a game-changer, tipping the balance towards accepting CAS as a safe, equally effective, and durable alternative to CEA for all patients requiring carotid revascularization; and 3) the technical advances in CAS after enrollment of patients in the CREST. CAS and CEA are complementary procedures. Judicious selection of the procedure is made on a case-by-case basis.
