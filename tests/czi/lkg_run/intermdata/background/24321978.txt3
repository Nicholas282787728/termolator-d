Infection control best practices in clinical research in resource-limited settings
Infection control activities in the international research setting include the development of meaningful and effective policies on specific topics such as hand and respiratory hygiene. Prevention of infection in health care workers and management of occupational exposure to transmissible agents are important aspects of the role of an infection control practitioner. Hand hygiene reduces health care associated infections and practices may be implemented in the research setting.
