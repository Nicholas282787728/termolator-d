Dermocosmetic management of the red face and rosacea
Erythematotelangiectatic rosacea is a frequent condition and affected patients benefit from medical treatments and dermatological procedures but also a complementary dermocosmetic assistance that aims at obtaining optimal skin comfort and preventing irritation of these particularly overreactive skins. Choice of dermocosmetics is crucial - especially in respect to their texture and the simplicity in ingredients - in order to optimize the application of the products and their tolerance. The addition of soothing and decongestant active ingredients is particularly important. Finally, photoprotection and a specific medical make-up are useful to attenuate the unattractive appearance of red faces.
