The emerging problem of diabetes in the seriously mentally ill
We describe the increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses such as obesity and type 2 diabetes have markedly increased in both developed and developing countries. We describe the relationship between type 2 diabetes and mental illness. The extant literature suggests a critical need for innovative treatments targeted to individuals with comorbid diabetes and mental illness. Given the complexity and challenge of both of these disorders in tandem with the interactive challenges and burdens of psychiatric and medical comorbidity, it is essential that interventions address the issue of mental and medical health from the perspective of the individual with the disorder, engage individuals to actively participate in illness self-management, and include consideration of the multiple barriers to care.
