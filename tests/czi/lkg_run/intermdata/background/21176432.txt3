Exploring the abyss of fibromyalgia biomarkers
Many researchers are studying fibromyalgia to identify objective, measurable biomarkers that may identify the patients, for the purpose of diagnosis or to measure the disease activity. The recent literature proposes instrumental or molecular biomarkers, but several of these are only useful for research purposes. Concentrated efforts to systematically evaluate additional objective measures in research trials will be vital for the ongoing progress in outcome research and translation into clinical practice. The aim of this review is a guided tour of the specific literature.
