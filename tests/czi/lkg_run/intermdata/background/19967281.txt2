Access barriers in early diagnosis of breast cancer in the Federal District and Oaxaca
To identify social, cultural and health service barriers that prevent timely access to early detection of breast cancer in two regions: Mexico City Federal District and the state of Oaxaca. An exploratory cross-sectional qualitative study was carried out in 2008 among women under 25 years of age without pathology, with pathological diagnosis, their male partners and managers of several public and private institutions. Information was collected by focus groups and through interviews that were recorded and transcribed after having received informed consent. Initial exploration allowed the identification of access barriers in three main areas: a) the availability of information for the general population, b) training of first-contact general practitioners and gynecologists, and c) fears among couples and families. Barriers in the three levels identified are relevant as they reveal important deficiencies in the dissemination of information both to the general population and to health providers.
