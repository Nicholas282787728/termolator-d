Home medical care center project for an aging society
We have to create a new paradigm for home medical care system towards a historical increase of elderly population in Japan. Tokyo University and Chiba University have been collaborating to erect a home medical care support center in Kashiwa, Chiba prefecture. We have been constructing a support center as well as a home care doctor system, and also created a teaching course for GPs to learn a home care doctor activity. We have also been constructing a regional network system called IT Net in Chiba, which connects all the entire medical and care staff. We will expand this model in many places and to instruct medical students and residents there in the near future.
