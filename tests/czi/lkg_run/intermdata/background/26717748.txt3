Preparation Polyacrylonitrile/Ag Nanoparticle Composite Nanofibers Via an Elelctrospinning Technique and Their Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering Study
In this paper, we have prepared polyacrylonitrile (PAN) /Ag nanoparticle composite nanofibers as a surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate via an electrospinning technique. First, the PAN and AgNO3 were dissolved in N, N'-dimethylformamide solvent to get PAN/Ag seed solution; then the PAN/Ag seed solution was electrospun for the preparation of PAN/Ag seed composite nanofibers; Finally, the PAN/Ag seed composite nanofibers were treated by hydrazine hydrate to syn- thesize PAN/Ag nanoparticle composite nanofibers. The as-prepared PAN/Ag nanoparticle composite nanofibers were mixed with the probes for the SERS detection to get the SERS spectrum of the probes. The PAN/Ag nanoparticle composite nanofibers substate showed a good SERS signal when the concentration of PATP is as low as 10(-6) mol x L(-1). Furthermore, this kind of SERS substrate could be large-scale prepared, which showed a high commercial value.
