Formation of Disinfection By-Products During Chlor(am)ination of Danjiangkou Reservoir Water and Comparison of Disinfection Processes
This study discussed the formation of volatile carbonaceous disinfection by-products (DBPs) and nitrogenous DBPs during chlor(am) ination of Danjingkou Reservoir water which was the source of the Middle Route Project of South-to-North Water Diversion Project. The effects of disinfection methods, disinfectant dosage, reaction time, pH values and bromide ion concentration were investigated. And the disinfection parameters were optimized. Four DBPs, including chloroform (CF), bromodichloromethane (BDCM), dichloroacetonitrile(DCAN) and trichloronitromethane(TCNM), were observed during the chlorination. But only CF and TCNM were detected during the chloramination of water. The disinfection by-product (DBP) concentration from chlorination is 7. 5 times higher than that from chloramination, and the yield of DBPs from short time chlorination then chloramination is in between the first two methods. All kinds of DBPs detected increased with the dosage of increasing chlorine, but the increases slowed down when the dosage was higher than 2 mg . L -1. The formation of CF varied a little as the dosage of chloramine increasing. TCNM was detected when the chloramine dosage was greater than 2 mg . L -1. As reaction time going on, chlorine decayed much faster than chloramine, while DBP formation under chlorination was faster than that of chloramination. THM produced by chlorine increased with the increasing pH, while chloramination showed no obvious changes. As the bromide ion increasing, the species of DBPs transformed from chlorinated DBPs to brominated ones, and the total yield of DBPs increased during both chlorination and chloramination, but the former one was obviously more than that of the latter one. In order to reduce the risk of DBP formation, the chloramination is suggested in the treatment of water from Danjiangkou Reservoir. And if chlorination is applied, the disinfectant dosage should be controlled seriously.
