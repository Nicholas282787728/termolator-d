The effectiveness of a postbaccalaureate program for students from disadvantaged backgrounds
This study examines the long-term effectiveness of an institutional postbaccalaureate program designed to provide an opportunity for students from disadvantaged backgrounds to enter medicine in response to diversity needs. An 18-year retrospective analysis of the academic outcomes, performance, progress, and specialty choices of postbaccalaureate participants. Comparisons across cohorts were conducted using chi-square tests, t tests, and ANOVA. Ninety-four percent (94%) of the postbaccalaureate students successfully completed the program and matriculated into medical school. Sixty-four percent (64%) of the matriculants have graduated from medical school, and 26% are still enrolled. More than 50% of the graduates selected primary care specialty fields. The implementation of the postbaccalaureate program provided a successful strategy to diversify the medical school student body and increase the number of physicians from disadvantaged backgrounds in the medical profession following the mission-driven commitment of the medical school.
