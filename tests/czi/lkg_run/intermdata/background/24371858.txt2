Perceptions of oral health by the WV community
This survey was undertaken to establish baseline measurements in regards to the oral health beliefs and practices of the general public throughout West Virginia as a starting point to create an effective educational initiative fostering oral health as an integral component of health. A population based 37 item telephonic opinion survey on a representative sample of WV state wide residents was conducted to understand practices, habits and experiences with oral health, to identify barriers to oral health, and determine the perception of its importance to other health conditions. West Virginians rank obesity as the most serious health problem and dental health a significantly less serious concern. Half admitted to less than good dental health. Cost was most commonly cited for not accessing oral care. A unified health promotion message among all health care providers is vital if general health of West Virginia citizens is to be improved. The links between oral health, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and pulmonary conditions can be used as a common starting point to embrace health advancement in general with the ultimate goal of changing current attitudes and practices and develop sustainable health programs that result in positive oral health/overall health in individuals and communities.
