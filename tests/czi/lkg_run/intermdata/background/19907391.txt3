Patient note fabrication and consequences of unprofessional behavior in a high-stakes clinical skills licensing examination
The National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners (NBOME) administers the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination USA Level 2-PE (COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE) and has developed a process that links the competencies of written communication and professionalism by tracking fabrication in the postencounter SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) note exercise. A process used to identify potential SOAP note fabrication was implemented in the 2007-2008 test cycle for the COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE. A total of 3,753 candidates took the COMLEX-USA Level 2-PE in the 2007-2008 test cycle. Forty-eight candidates were screened, and the NBOME's Subcommittee on SOAP Note Fabrication made failure decisions on eight, leading to a failure rate of 0.2% based on fabrication review. The NBOME has adopted the stance that postencounter note fabrication represents unprofessional behavior. Screening for and failing candidates who exhibit unprofessional behavior enhances the validity of the examination.
