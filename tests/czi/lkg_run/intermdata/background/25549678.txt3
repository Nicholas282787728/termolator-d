Clinical, magnetic resonance imaging and neuroelectrophysiological characteristics of 14 patients with lumbosacralradiculitis
To improve the understanding of lumbosacralradiculitis by analyzing the clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuroeletrophysiological characteristics of disease. The clinical, MRI and neuroeletrophysiological data of 14 patients diagnosed as lumbosacralradiculitis were retrospectively analyzed. The predominant age of onset was in the forth decade. Each patient had bilateral or unilateral lower extremity numbness and weakness of variable severity, including muscle atrophy (n = 5) and decreased sensation in L4-S1 nerve root territory (n = 9). Lower extremity tendon reflexes decreased or became absent in all patients. Urinary and defecation disorders were seen in 3 patients. Lumbosacral MRI showed lumbosacral meninges and nerve root enhancement in 4 patients. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed elevated white blood cell (30Ã—10(6)/L) (n = 1) and increased protein content (n = 12) (450-1 000 mg/L, n = 7; 1 000-2 000 mg/L, n = 3; 2 000-3 000 mg/L, n = 2). Needle electromyography (EMG) demonstrated neurogenic damage in 13 patients. Motor nerve conduction study showed decreased motor never conduction velocity (MCV) (n = 5), decreased compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude (n = 12), CMAP absent at right side (n = 2) and left side (n = 1) among 22 peroneal nerves; decreased MCV (n = 6), decreased CMAP amplitude (n = 6), CMAP absent at right side (n = 2) and left side (n = 1) among 23 tibial nerves. F-wave was performed for 11 patients and abnormal in 6 patients, with prolonged latency and reduced occurrence rate in right common peroneal nerve (n = 2), left prolonged latency (n = 3) and right tibial nerve (n = 1) respectively. Bilateral sural nerve conduction study revealed no abnormality. Diagnosing lumbosacralradiculitis is not easy based on lumbosacral MRI. And neuroelectrophysiological study may provide more valuable information in verifying the location of lesions and judging the damage extent of lumbosacralradiculitis.
