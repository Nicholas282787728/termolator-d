Current status of home palliative care
In order to push forward with home palliative care under the regional alliance in Iwaki city, we worked toward building a medical network. The current main four actions are: 1 ) Educational medical training course for palliative skill-improvement in the regional party of Iwaki city medical associate, 2 ) Combined educational and medical training for home palliative care and an assembly of regional alliance, 3 ) Critical path for the regional alliance of palliative care, and 4 ) Iwaki palliative therapy research. However, the present status of these actions has not been working well in supporting of home palliative care under the hospital-clinic cooperation. On the other hand, we actually felt that the regional alliance called face to face cooperation between doctors and many paramedics was proceeding well. In our department as a whole, the palliative cases with the help of regional alliance have been increasing. We also experienced with home palliative care under the hospital clinic cooperation. The most important action is to notify the medical offices of clinics and hospitals to let them acknowledge that we have been actively providing home palliative care and services. Moreover, it is also necessary to introduce our palliative care and services to medical offices when a patient is in the early stage of the disease.
