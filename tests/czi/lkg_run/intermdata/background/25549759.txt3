Physical regulation of stem cells differentiation into teno-lineage: current strategies and future direction
Tendon injuries are commonly encountered in the clinic, disrupting the patient's normal work/life routine and damaging the career life of athletes. Currently, there is still no effective treatment for tendon injury. Tendon tissue engineering appears to be a promising route for tendon repair and regeneration. However, current strategies utilized in research are still far away from clinical applications due to unsuccessful cellular differentiation to tendon/tenocytes. In this review, we focus on the current physical strategies (mechanical stimulation and extracellular matrix topography) and evaluate their roles in precise and stepwise tendon differentiation. A systematic comprehension of normal tendon development process by structure, gene profile and physical microenvironment analysis is likely suggestive for stepwise tenocyte differentiation.
