Mandibular angle split osteotomy based on a novel augmented reality navigation using specialized robot-assisted arms-A feasibility study
Augmented reality (AR) navigation, is a visible 3-dimensional display technology, that, when combined with robot-assisted surgery (RAS), allows precision and automation in operational procedures. In this study, we used an innovative, minimally invasive, simplified operative method to position the landmarks and specialized robot-assisted arms to apply in a rapid protyping (RP) model. This is the first report of the use of AR and RAS technology in craniomaxillofacial surgery. Five patients with prominent mandibular angle were randomly chosen for this feasibility study. We reconstructed the mandibular modules and created preoperational plans as semi-embedded and nail-fixation modules for an easy registration procedure. The left side of the mandibular modules comprised the experimental groups with use of a robot, and the right sides comprised the control groups without a robot. With AR Toolkits program tracking and display system applied, we carried out the operative plans and measured the error. Both groups were successfully treated in this study, but the RAS was more accurate and stable. The average position and angle were significant (p   0.01) between the 2 groups. This study reports a novel augmented reality navigation with specialized robot-assisted arms for mandibular angle split osteotomy. AR and RAS can be helpful for patients undergoing craniomaxillofacial surgery.
