OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment of mild glabellar lines in repose
OnabotulinumtoxinA is an established treatment for glabellar frown lines, but its effects on lines at repose are less well documented. To assess the effect of onabotulinumtoxinA on elimination of mild lines at repose. Data from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were included. Elimination of mild lines at repose was defined as change from mild to none on the Facial Wrinkle Scale. Analysis included 183 participants who received 20 U of onabotulinumtoxinA and 64 participants who received placebo, all with mild lines at repose at baseline. Participants were evaluated 7, 30, 60, 90, and 120 days posttreatment. Compared to placebo, onabotulinumtoxinA-treated participants were significantly more likely to have their lines at repose eliminated at each study day; [odds ratios ranged from 42.7 (95% confidence interval (CI)=12.9-141.9) at day 30 to 4.9 (95% CI=2.2-10.8) at day 120 (p<.0001 at each day)]. The highest response rate was observed at day 30 (68%). OnabotulinumtoxinA has demonstrated the ability to eliminate mild glabellar lines at repose for a significant number of patients. This effect, albeit more subtle than the effect on dynamic or more severe glabellar lines, may be an important treatment goal for patients who seek a smoother appearance at repose.
