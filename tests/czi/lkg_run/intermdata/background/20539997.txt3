Perceptions and use of complementary and alternative medicine in American Samoa: a survey of health care providers
American Samoa health care providers' use and perceptions of common complementary and alternative treatments, with a focus on traditional Samoan healing for women diagnosed with breast cancer or cervical cancer, was investigated to inform the development of the first locally produced women's cancer prevention radio drama and the first cancer patient navigator program in the US Territory. A 10-item self-administered survey was completed by a total of 47 health care providers employed at the Lyndon B. Johnson Tropical Medical Center and the American Samoa Department of Health Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Comprehensive health care is limited in American Samoa, especially cancer treatment. Dissatisfaction or disconnection with Western medicine leads some patients to seek complementary or alternative health care from traditional Samoan healers who provide massage and herbal remedies. Health care providers in American Samoa use and recommend many complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) popular in the United States. The most common CAM recommended to patients is exercise (81%), diet modification (81%), prayer (36%), massage (36%), support group participation (26%), and relaxation techniques (19%). Traditional Samoan healing methods are unique CAM that 19% of mainstream health care providers have used, and 17% have recommended these techniques to patients. Most survey respondents believe traditional Samoan healing methods have a harmful effect on patient quality of life and 72% have advised a patient to discontinue using this type of CAM. While most providers feel that the majority of American Samoan patients use traditional healing methods to complement Western healthcare, 55% are aware of a breast cancer or cervical cancer patient utilizing these techniques as an alternative to hospital treatment. A provider's ethnicity, gender, age and years of professional experience appear to be indicators of different CAM method endorsement and patient consultations concerning CAM use. CAM use is likely to continue in American Samoa as long as health care deficiencies exist. Most American Samoa health care professionals accept common CAM in the United States, but local providers are more likely to endorse traditional healing methods than their mainland counterparts. Little is known of the impact different CAM have on quality of life, especially amongst cancer patients. The majority of American Samoa health care providers request more information about tradition al healing which would facilitate more comprehensive medical documentation and patient care.
