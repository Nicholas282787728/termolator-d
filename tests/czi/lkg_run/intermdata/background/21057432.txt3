The effect of one left-sided dorsolateral prefrontal cortical HF-rTMS session on emotional brain processes in women
Although repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is frequently used to examine emotional changes in healthy volunteers, it remains largely unknown how rTMS is able to influence emotion.We carried out a sham-controlled single-blind crossover study using fMRI, we examined in 20 right-handed healthy female volunteers whether a single high frequency (HF)-rTMS session applied to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) could influence emotional processing while focussing on blocks of positively and negatively valenced baby faces. A single HF-rTMS session selectively influenced the processing of positively and negatively valenced baby faces. In essence, our results indicate that the effects of one left-sided HF-rTMS sessions results in improved processing of positive emotions and reduced negative emotional processing in never depressed female subjects.
