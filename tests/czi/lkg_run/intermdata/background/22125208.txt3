Conditioning the heart in cardiac surgery
Cardiac surgery is associated with ischaemic and reperfusion injury to the myocardium. It seems natural to seek a possibility of inducing the natural endoprotective mechanisms known as myocardial conditioning, including preconditioning, postconditioning, and remote conditioning. Still, in spite of almost 20 years of research in the field, we are far from routine widespread usage of these methods, with published reports describing quite various, and often contradictory results. Current review summarises the trials of using the conditioning in cardiac surgical practice including pharmacological manipulations to induce resistance to ischaemia-reperfusion.
