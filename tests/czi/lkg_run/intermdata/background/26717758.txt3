Review of Crop Canopy Spectral Information Detection Technology and Methods
Compared with the traditional chemical methods and the subjective visual ways for measuring plant physiology information indicators, the assessments of crop canopy information through spectral radiometer are more simple, rapid and accurate. The applications of different types of spectral radiometer, especially for international general used Cropscan multispectral radiometer, for predicting crop canopy leaf area index under different growth stage, biomass, nitrogen, chlorophyll and yield, and monitoring plant diseases and insect pests were summarized based on crop group information acquisition methods in recent years. The varity of vegetation indices (VIs) were concluded after comparing regression coefficients of related models among different crops. In general, the correlation coefficients of mathematical models were high and it can realize the crop detection of various kinds of physiological information. Besides, the combination of multispectral radiometer and other sensors can provide useful information to evaluate the status of crops growth, which is very important in practice.
