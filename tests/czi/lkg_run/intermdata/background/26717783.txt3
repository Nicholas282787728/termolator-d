LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS AND FUNCTIONS AFTER RENAL TRANSPLANTATION AT OUR HOSPITAL
We investigated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and function in patients who had undergone renal transplantation (RTx). Fifty patients (34 males and 16 females; age 16-68 years) undergoing RTx at our hospital were included in this study. Average follow-up after RTx was 6.1 years (range 0.5-28). The pre-transplant dialysis period averaged 2.5 years (range preemptive-18.6 years). We conducted the evaluation of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and function using uroflowmetry (UFM) , residual urine measurement, 24h bladder diary, International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), QOL score, Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) and Core Lower Urinary Tract Symptom Score (CLSS). Average first desire to void and maximum desire to void were 89.9 mL and 185 mL respectively in cystometry before RTx. Atrophy of the bladder before RTx showed a correlation with the dialysis period. UFM of post-RTx was maximum urinary flow rate of 21.8 mL/s and a voided volume of 287.6 mL. Severe cases of IPSS, QOL, OABSS and CLSS were not observed. Average 24h voided volume, urination times and nocturia were 2,329 mL, 8.2 times and 0.9 times respectively. Polyuria after RTx was observed in 21 patients (42%). Aging and vascular lesions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease were the most important factor of LUTS. After RTx, LUTS were present in a number of cases after RTx. Patients undergoing RTx has been aging, it is considered necessary to perform the evaluation of LUTS before RTx.
