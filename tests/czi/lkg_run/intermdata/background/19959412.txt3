Drug-drug interactions with raltegravir
To review all currently published drug-drug interaction studies with the HIV-integrase inhibitor raltegravir. A PubMed search was conducted for all published reports up to August 1, 2009 as well as a review of updated European and US Prescriber's Information (EMEA and FDA) and abstracts from recent international scientific meetings. A total of 14 drug-drug interaction studies were found. Due to the relatively broad therapeutic range of raltegravir almost all co-administered agents can safely be combined with raltegravir, with the exception of rifampin in which a doubling of the raltegravir dose to 800 mg BD is currently recommended. Raltegravir is not without drug-drug interactions but due to the lack of an effect on CYP450 or UGT by raltegravir and the broad therapeutic range of raltegravir itself, this agent can safely combined with almost all tested agents.
