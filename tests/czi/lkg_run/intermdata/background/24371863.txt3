Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy: a diagnostic conundrum
A 31 year old woman who was 16 weeks pregnant was admitted because of headache, blurred vision, excessive weight gain, and hirsutism. Laboratory tests showed low adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and elevated serum and urinary cortisol. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a left adrenal mass. Left adrenalectomy was done, and histopathology showed an adrenal adenoma. The patient had an uncomplicated delivery after 37 weeks of gestation. Cushing's syndrome is very rare in pregnancy. It may be difficult to diagnose because the clinical and laboratory signs of Cushing's syndrome may be similar to those of pregnancy.
