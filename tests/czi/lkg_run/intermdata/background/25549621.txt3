Antimicrobial compounds from seaweeds-associated bacteria and fungi
In recent decade, seaweeds-associated microbial communities have been significantly evaluated for functional and chemical analyses. Such analyses let to conclude that seaweeds-associated microbial communities are highly diverse and rich sources of bioactive compounds of exceptional molecular structure. Extracting bioactive compounds from seaweed-associated microbial communities have been recently increased due to their broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, anti-settlement, antiprotozoan, antiparasitic, and antitumor. These allelochemicals not only provide protection to host from other surrounding pelagic microorganisms, but also ensure their association with the host. Antimicrobial compounds from marine sources are promising and priority targets of biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications. This review describes the bioactive metabolites reported from seaweed-associated bacterial and fungal communities and illustrates their bioactivities. Biotechnological application of metagenomic approach for identifying novel bioactive metabolites is also dealt, in view of their future development as a strong tool to discover novel drug targets from seaweed-associated microbial communities.
