Preinvasive lesion of the uterine cervix can give rise to cervical cancer. High-risk human papillomaviruses with high oncogenic potential are considered to be the main etiopathological factors with interaction of other risk factors (recurrent inflammation of the cervix, injury of the cervix, immunosuppressive conditions, sexual promiscuity, etc.).
