Wrinkles analysis and representation by 2D imaging
In clinical evaluation, digital photography is a valuable low-cost and easy to use tool to illustrate assessments; hence the temptation to use it for analysis purposes, particularly in the assessment of facial wrinkles (forehead wrinkles, crow's feet). We review different methods to quantify the volume from 2D images, most of them directly adapted from algorithms initially developed in 3D profilometry. The 3D representation of these photographs is also detailed using several examples. Finally, the limits and drawbacks of this 3D pseudo quantification are listed and compared with those usually found in classic profilometry.
