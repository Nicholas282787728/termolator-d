How is time used within the orthopaedic trauma theatre?
Theatre efficiency has gained increasing attention though the Productive Operating Theatre (TPOT) initiative from the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement. However, literature specifically exploring how time is used within theatre is limited. Running a theatre is expensive and so it is essential to maximise efficiency (NHS III2009). A retrospective review of trauma lists in two district general hospitals has identified areas where time is wasted and highlighted areas for improvement.
