Polymyalgia rheumatica can recur years after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy
To describe disease recurrence in polymyalgia rheumatica. I present 12 patients with recurring PMR from a single clinical practice with long-term clinical follow-up (mean 14.3 years). Despite a disease-free interval off corticosteroids of 2 years or longer, these patients experienced 1 overt recurrence (or more) of PMR. The course of PMR is not uniformly monophasic, and patient and physician should remain alert to the possibility of recurring disease.
