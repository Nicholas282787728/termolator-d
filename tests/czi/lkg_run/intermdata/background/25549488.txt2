Fat embolism syndrome in skeletal trauma: particularities of the diagnosis, economic aspects and the role of non-invasive ventilation in intensive care
The article deals with a multicenter study that demonstrates the possibility and feasibility of noninvasive ventilation in patients with skeletal trauma complicated wiith fat embolism syndrome. The authors found additional criteria for the severity of the condition of patients with trauma. Important criteria for the choose a type of ventilation (non-invasive and invasive) is the lack of consciousness, desynchronization of a patient with ventilator and the need for a specialized regimes or miorelaxation to synchronize with the respirator.
