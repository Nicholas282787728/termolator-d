Effect of weight reduction on leptin, total ghrelin and obestatin concentrations in prepubertal children
The aim of the study was to evaluate fasting levels of glucose, insulin, leptin, total ghrelin, and obestatin in a group of prepubescent obese children before and after weight loss. We enrolled 64 prepubescent obese children, but only 35 completed the study (mean age 7.6 +- 0.9 years, 19 females) and 20 normal-weight prepubescent children as controls. Fasting plasma concentration of glucose, insulin, Homeostasis Model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and leptin, total ghrelin, and obestatin levels were measured at baseline and after a 6-month lifestyle intervention (i.e. improved nutrition and increased physical activity). At baseline, obese children showed significantly (p less than 0.001) higher leptin and obestatin levels, and lower total ghrelin concentrations than control subjects. Weight loss significantly (p less than 0.001) diminished plasma leptin and insulin levels and increased ghrelin and obestatin concentrations. Weight loss in prepubescent children is associated with a significant change in leptin, ghrelin and obestatin concentrations. These results confirm the hypothesis that levels of these hormones are closely associated with obesity in childhood and might take part, as consequence but not as a cause, in glucose, fat, and energy metabolism.
