Importance of donor site vascular imaging in free fibula flap reconstruction
Free fibula flap is widely used in head and neck reconstruction. Imaging studies of the donor site can reveal vascular abnormalities and therefore prevent acute leg ischemia. Evaluation of the role of donor site vascular imaging studies for free fibula flap planing. Out of 35 free flap reconstructions performed in Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Department in Medical University in Lublin in 2011-2012, there were 10 fibula flaps. Each patient had preoperative lower leg subtraction angiography performed. Lower leg angiography revealed vascular abnormalities in two out of 10 patients scheduled for free fibula flap transfer. One had dominant peroneal artery and second occlusion of anterior tibial artery. In both cases fibula was harvested from the other leg. Imaging studies reveal lower leg vascular abnormalities in 20% of cases thus facilitate surgical plans alternations and prevent serious complications in free fibula flap patients.
