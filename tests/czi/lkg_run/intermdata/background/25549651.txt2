Clinical analysis of 126 cases of severe precocious preeclampsia complicated with fetal growth retardation
To explore the clinical characteristics and maternal and infant prognosis of severe precocious preeclampsia complicated with fetal growth retardation. A study was conducted for 126 patients with early onset severe preeclampsia. According to the gestational week (GW) of morbility, they were divided into group A (GW<28, n = 36), group B (28 ≤ GW<32, n = 40) and group C (32 ≤ GW<34, n = 50). And then compare the respective clinical characteristics and the result of mother and infant. At admission, no statistical difference existed among 3 groups in blood pressure, blood platelets, 24 h urine protein quantity, urea nitrogen, D-2 polymer or serum creatinine (P > 0.05).the rate of complication declined with advancing gestational weeks of morbility in all three groups. And the composition of complication indicated no statistical difference (P > 0.05); there existed statistical difference in asphyxia neonatorum and perinatal mortality rates between any two of three groups (P < 0.05 for all). Comparing expectant treatment time and delivery method of three groups, the expectant time of Group B was obviously longer than those of the other two, both indicated statistical difference (P < 0.05). However, the difference had no statistical significance between groups A and C (P > 0.05). And uterine-incision delivery was the major delivery mode among all three groups. The rates of asphyxia neonatorum and perinatal mortality decline with advancing gestational weeks of morbility in cases of severe precocious preeclampsia complicated with fetal growth retardation. Therefore, for reducing the perinatal mortality rate, proper measures include early diagnosis, active treatment, close supervision of mother and fetal conditions and termination of gestation when necessary.
