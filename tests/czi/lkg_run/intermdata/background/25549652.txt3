Evaluation of the inadequate diagnostic rate of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology inthyroid calcified nodules
To evaluate the inadequate diagnostic rate of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology (USFNAC) in thyroid calcified nodules. 208 thyroid calcified nodules in 202 patients were retrospective analyzed, and all of the nodules were acquired cytological diagnosis. There was no significant complication in the all 208 thyroid calcified nodules. The inadequate diagnostic rate was 25.5% in thyroid calcified nodules. The inadequate diagnostic rates in micro calcifications , macro calcifications and circumjacent arc calcifications were 16.0%, 26.4% and 76.5%. The inadequate diagnostic rate in circumjacent arc calcifications were higher than those in micro calcifications and macro calcifications (P   0.01) , and the rates were no significance in micro calcifications and macro calcifications. There was no statistical significance in different size of thyroid calcified nodules. The inadequate diagnostic rate in circumjacent arc calcifications was higher, and should to avoid USFNAC in these nodules.
