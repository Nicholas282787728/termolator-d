Six Cases of Myofibroma - The Adult Counterpart of Infantile Myofibromatosis: Case Report
The adult counterpart of infantile myofibromatosis is rare and is known as myofibroma. Cases are rare, and previous ones have been reported as isolated case reports; hence, there has been no consensus regarding the clinical presentation, surgical reconstruction, histological features, and recurrence of hand myofibromas. Over a 10-year period, the senior author treated 6 patients. We review our cases as well as 6 previously reported cases. The presentation is usually a single hand mass in a young adult. The tumor may arise from the lower dermis or from deeper fibrous structures of the hand including the palmar fascia. Tumors that arise from the dermis are best treated by skin excision to ensure complete excision. Histologically, the tumor is composed of highly cellular myofibroblast proliferation and is strongly positive to smooth muscle actin immune stain. The recurrence rate after excision is low.
