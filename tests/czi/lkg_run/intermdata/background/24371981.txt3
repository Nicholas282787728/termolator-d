Negative pressure therapy- supportive method in chronic wound treatment
Negative pressure sound therapy is one of the supportive options for chronic wound treatment. Good results have been reported in increasing angiogenesis, improving blood flow in the wounds, decreasing edema, regulating moist environment, granulation tissue stimulation and wound retraction. In addition, there is significant reduction in bacterial burden and in the amount of harmful products (exotoxins, endotoxins, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases) in the wound. The healing time for chronic wounds is reduced in comparison with other conservative treatments.
