Botulinum toxin A in the treatment of wrinkles in the upper third of the face
The practice of botulinum toxin injections is unavoidable in the correction of facial aging. In effect botulinum toxin allows to erase dynamic wrinkles, by transient and reversible muscular relaxation. This is the best wrinkle treatment for the upper part of the face: glabellar lines, horizontal forehead lines and crow's feet. This technique requires a good understanding of facial muscular anatomy, in order to correctly apply the basics of injection. Every patient is unique and only a big experience will allow to refine and personalise injections.
