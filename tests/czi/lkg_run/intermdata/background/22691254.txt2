Nasal polyposis in children
Nasal polyposis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the nasal cavity and the paranasal sinuses. It is a relatively common disease, occurring in 1-4 % of the general population, but it is rarely described in the pediatric population. Most of the published series include children presenting with other underlying systemic diseases, mainly cystic fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to describe the characteristics of the patients suffering from nasal polyposis, evaluated at the Pediatric Clinic of the University of Pavia (Italy) over the last 17 years. 56 consecutive pediatric patients referring to our Pediatric Department had a diagnosis of nasal poyposis over the last 17 years. All children underwent allergy evaluation, nasal endoscopy, CT scan of the paranasal sinus, and Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery. The mean age of the present cohort was of 11.8 years and most of the patients were male. 50% of the patients presented with unilateral, polyposis, mostly with a diagnosis of antrochoanal polyp. 4 patients presenting with bilateral polyposis suffered from cystic fibrosis. Main symptoms at diagnosis included nasal obstruction, snoring and rhinorrhea 32% of the patients presented at least a positivity to skin prick test, for major inhalant and food allergens. Nasal polyposis in children could represent an alert sign for other underlying systemic diseases. Nasal endoscopy should therefore be prescribed when a diagnosis is suspected. To properly treat a patient presenting with nasal polyposis, it is necessary to integrate medical and surgical skills through a multidisciplinary approach.
