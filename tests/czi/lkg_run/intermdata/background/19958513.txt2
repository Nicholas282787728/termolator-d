Gevab: a prototype genome variation analysis browsing server
The first Korean individual diploid genome sequence data (KOREF) was publicized in December 2008. A Korean genome variation analysis and browsing server (Gevab) was constructed as a database and web server for the exploration and downloading of Korean personal genome(s). Information in the Gevab includes SNPs, short indels, and structural variation (SV) and comparison analysis between the NCBI human reference and the Korean genome(s). The user can find information on assembled consensus sequences, sequenced short reads, genetic variations, and relationships between genotype and phenotypes. This server is openly and publicly available online at http:-koreagenome.org/en/ or directly http:-gevab.org.
