Efforts to decrease diabetes-related amputations in African Americans by the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Charleston and Georgetown Diabetes Coalition
Diabetes is the leading cause of amputation of the lower limbs. Yet, half of these amputations might be prevented through simple but effective foot care practices. This article describes the progress made in the reduction of lower extremity amputations in people with diabetes by the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) Charleston and Georgetown Diabetes Coalition. The coalition's community action plan and interventions were based on an expanded Chronic Care Model that spawned changes in policies, health and education systems, and other community systems for people with diabetes and their support systems.
