A workflow for multiclass determination of 256 pesticides in essential oils by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using evaporation and dilution approaches: Application to lavandin, lemon and cypress essential oils
This paper describes the determination of 256 multiclass pesticides in cypress and lemon essential oils (EOs) by the way of liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) analysis using the scheduled selected reaction monitoring mode (sSRM) available on a hybrid quadrupole linear ion trap (QLIT) mass spectrometer. The performance of a sample preparation of lemon and cypress EOs based on dilution or evaporation under nitrogen assisted by a controlled heating were assessed. The best limits of quantification (LOQs) were achieved with the evaporation under nitrogen method giving LOQs≤10µgL(-1) for 91% of the pesticides. In addition the very satisfactory results obtained for recovery, repeatability and linearity showed that for EOs of relatively low evaporation temperature, a sample preparation based on evaporation under nitrogen is well adapted and preferable to dilution. By compiling these results with those previously published by some of us on lavandin EO, we proposed a workflow dedicated to multiresidue determination of pesticides in various EOs by LC-ESI/sSRM. Among the steps involved in this workflow, the protocol related to mass spectrometry proposes an alternative confirmation method to the classical SRM ratio criteria based on a sSRM survey scan followed by an information-dependent acquisition using the sensitive enhanced product ion (EPI) scan to generate MS/MS spectra then compared to a reference. The submitted workflow was applied to the case of lemon EOs samples highlighting for the first time the simultaneous detection of 20 multiclass pesticides in one EO. Some pesticides showed very high concentration levels with amounts greatly exceeding the mgL(-1).
