Evaluating temsirolimus activity in multiple tumors: a review of clinical trials
Activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling occurs in a wide variety of human tumors and can lead to increased susceptibility to mTOR inhibitors. Temsirolimus, a novel analog of rapamycin, has shown promising preclinical and early clinical anti-tumor activity in various solid and hematologic tumor types, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or other targeted agents. Randomized phase III trials have already demonstrated significant clinical benefits of treatment with single-agent temsirolimus in advanced renal cell carcinoma and relapsed and/or refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Other malignancies studied in the phase I and II trial settings include glioblastoma, breast cancer, endometrial cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. This article reviews a comprehensive collection of the clinical trial results reported to date for temsirolimus in various solid and hematologic malignancies, as well as current strategies being tested in ongoing trials. The findings with temsirolimus in multiple tumors provide a valuable framework for future development of temsirolimus and other mTOR inhibitors.
