Could be a link between non atopic asthma and HP infection?
A potential role of Helicobater Pylori (HP) infection in several extra-intestinal pathologies has been recently suggested. The aim of our study was to assess the role of serology positive for HP in atopic and non atopic infants and children affected by atopic dermatitis, urticaria, rhinitis and asthma. We included 615 children affected by atopic diseases. According to prick test positivity and age, we divided the patients into two groups: atopic or non-atopic patients and infants (0-2 years) or children (2-12 years). The serum levels of antibodies for H. pylori immunoglobulin G were measured by using an ELISA test. We found a not significant difference between group 1 and group 2 about atopy. There was a significant higher frequency of HP positive serology in older children. As for infants, a higher significant prevalence of HP positive serology was found in non-atopic patients. HP positive serology was significantly higher only in non-atopic infants affected by atopic dermatitis and urticaria than in atopic. In group 2, non atopic children shown a significant increase in the prevalence of HP serum positivity than atopic children. As for asthma, there was an higher prevalence of HP serology positive in non atopic asthmatic children group than in atopic asthmatics. On the contrary, the prevalence of positive HP serology was not significantly different between atopic and non atopic children affected by dermatitis, urticaria, and rhinitis. The present data confirm an inverse association between HP positive serology and atopy in both groups. However, the higher prevalence of positive HP serology was observed in non atopic asthmatics children than in atopic asthmatics. We could speculate that HP infection can favour non-atopic asthma onset.
