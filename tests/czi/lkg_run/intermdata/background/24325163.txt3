Preinvasive lesions in gynecology -  vulva
For preinvasive lesions of vulva, a common term VIN -  vulval intraepithelial neoplasia is used. VIN is a histological dia-gnosis based on abnormal squamous epithelial proliferation. There are two types of VIN apart from their association with human papillomavirus (HPV). Undifferentiated (usual) vulval intraepithelial neoplasia is commonly associated with carcinogenic genotypes of HVP, whereas differentiated vulval intraepithelial neoplasia is not associated with high-risk genotypes of HPV. The article presents an overview of VIN occurence and epidemiology, its classification system and dia-gnostics. In conclusion, VIN therapeutical possibilities are presented. It can be treated with surgical therapy (local excision, partial vulvectomy, vulvectomy, laser vaporization) or medical therapy (imiquimod).
