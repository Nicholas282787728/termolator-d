How to Perform and Interpret a High-resolution Anorectal Manometry Test
High-resolution anorectal manometry (HR-ARM) and high-definition anorectal manometry (HD-ARM) catheters have closely spaced water-perfused or solid state circumferentially-oriented pressure sensors that provide much better spatiotemporal pressurization than non-high resolution catheters. This is a comprehensive review of HR-ARM and HD-ARM anorectal manometry catheter systems, the methods for conducting, analyzing, and interpreting HR-ARM and HD-ARM, and a comparison of HR-ARM with non-high resolution anorectal manometry. Compared to non-high resolution techniques, HR-ARM and HD-ARM studies take less time and are easier to interpret. However, HR-ARM and HD-ARM catheters are more expensive and fragile and have a shorter lifespan. Further studies are needed to refine our understanding of normal values and to rigorously evaluate the incremental clinical utility of HR-ARM or HD-ARM compared to non-high resolution manometry.
