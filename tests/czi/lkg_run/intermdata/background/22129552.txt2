Neonatal intensive care perspective
The hemodynamic evaluation and monitoring in the critically ill newborn (particularly the premature infant) poses unique challenges because of urgency, size limitations, and the persistence of fetal shunt channels. Echocardiography and other noninvasive methods are currently the mainstay of hemodynamic assessment. Evaluation of the hemodynamic significance of the arterial duct in the premature infant and cardiac performance in the near-term and term newborn with asphyxia, shock, and persistent pulmonary hypertension need to be more carefully refined, particularly assessments of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction. There is a need for evaluating a number of assessments as targets of goal-directed therapy in the unstable newborn infant. We provide an interpretation of the evidence supporting various monitoring strategies.
