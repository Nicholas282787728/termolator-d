Effects of non-physical factors on neck and shoulder pain and low back pain of adolescents
To explore the incidence of self-reported neck/shoulder pain (NSP) and lower back pain (LBP) among Chinese adolescents in Shanghai and identify the influencing factors for the incidences of these musculoskeletal disorders. A total of 3 600 students were selected from 30 high schools randomly chosen from 237 regular full-time high schools registered in Shanghai. From each school, 40 students were selected from each of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades for a total of 120 students per school. The questionnaire involved questions pertaining to demographic information, learning environment and exercise habits of each student. The questionnaire also contained questions regarding the amount of weight carried by each student while commuting to and from school. And it was also used to collect specific information related with the occurrence of NSP and LBP. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the potential risk factors for NSP and LBP. Among 3 600 distributed questionnaires, a total of 2 842 valid questionnaires were returned. The results revealed that the incidences of NSP and LBP in the Chinese adolescent population were 41.1% and 32.8%, respectively. Both NSP and LBP were more common in girls than in boys. And 6.3% students reported at least one NSP- or LBP-induced absence from school. Chinese adolescents generally experienced a heavy academic burden (32.7% failing to achieve daily academic goals) and mental stress (16.3% suffering from insomnia); the problem of insufficient sleep was even more pronounced (52.0% falling asleep after midnight and 64.3% suffering insufficient sleep while only 31.9% feeling physically relaxed after awaking). The multivariate Logistic regression analysis suggested that gender, grade, academic burden, stress and sleep situation had a significant correlation with NSP and LBP in adolescents. The incidences of NSP and LBP are relatively high among adolescents in Shanghai. And several factors, including sedentary behaviors, personal exercise habits and backpack weight, influences the occurrences of NSP and LBP in youth.
