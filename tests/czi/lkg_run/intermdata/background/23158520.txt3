Relationship between sleep/wakefulness and gastroesophageal reflux in symptomatic newborns
The state of sleep/wakefulness is well known to influence esophageal acid exposure and the number of acid refluxes whereas it is uncertain whether the same is true of the non-acid refluxes that predominate in the newborns. To investigate the relationship between sleep/wakefulness and refluxes 45 newborns with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms were studied with combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring. We found that sleep/wakefulness influenced acid and weakly acidic reflux frequency (awake 2.6+/-0.8; asleep 2.1+/-1.1; p=0.006). A negative correlation was found between sleepness periods and the mean reflux duration for both acid (R=0.55;p   0.001) and weackly acidic (R=0.51;p   0.001) refluxes. This finding may raise some concerns about the over-prescription of antacid drugs in newborns.
