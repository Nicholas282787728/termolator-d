Warning! Dopaminergic Modulation of the Superior Colliculus
Recent work by Bolton et al. describes a dopaminergic input to the superior colliculus (SC) from the zona incerta, as well as the organization of D1- and D2-receptor expression in the SC. We discuss a potential role for this input in modulating SC-mediated behavior, particularly in response to aversive stimuli.
