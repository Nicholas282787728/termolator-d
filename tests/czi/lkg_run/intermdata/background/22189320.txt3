The role of home palliative care by health insurance pharmacy
Our Pharmacy has been practicing pharmaceutical management guidance for 69 homecare patients in the last 13 years. After we started a home parenteral nutrition service, an opportunity to work with the end-stage cancer patient was increased. To contribute to the patient and community health team, we have practiced pharmaceutical management guidance for homecare patient based on the medical and pharmacology point of view with other area of occupational people. We distributed a pain diary and medical usage of drug guidance to the end-stage cancer outpatients. We also made a drug instructional manual and provided a proper prescription to the patient. Because of our efforts, we believe that we had good consistent results from the end-stage cancer outpatients. On the other hand, we have a lot of problems that have to be resolved. They are associated with medical treatment fee, drug dispensing fee, pharmacy management pressure felt from a low dispensing fee, poor quality stocked narcotic drugs and a low recognition of the pharmacist from the patients and regional community medical team. We believe that we can contribute more to the patients, if we can overcome these problems.
