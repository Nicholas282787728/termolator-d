Infections transmitted from the mother to the fetus: diagnostic issues and management of pregnancy
Some infections are considered as feared risks during pregnancy. These infections may lead to severe damage of the fetus or the newborn depending on the infectious agent and the term of pregnancy where the infection occurred.
