Occult sinusitis may be a key feature for non-controlled asthma in children
Sinusitis is frequently associated with asthma. The diagnosis and management of patients with asthma associated with sinusitis are often challenging, though sometimes unsatisfactory. Detection and treatment of sinusitis in asthmatics may lead to a better control of asthma symptoms. Most of the studies regarding the relationship between sinusitis and asthma have been conducted in adults. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of sinusal comorbidity in children with un-controlled asthma both clinically and through nasal endoscopy after the first 6 months of treatment. The present study included 294 consecutive asthmatic children (97 males, mean age 7.3 years). Asthma diagnosis, severity assessment and treatment were performed according to GINA guidelines. Twenty-one patients with non-controlled asthma presented with endoscopic features of sinusitis, but without any clinical sign or symptom. We defined such condition occult sinusitis. Not only overt sinusitis, but also occult sinusitis could be a significant comorbidity in asthmatic patients. For this reason, it may be beneficial to determine the presence of sinus inflammation in children with non-controlled asthma, even when they do not present clinical signs or symptoms of upper airways involvement.
