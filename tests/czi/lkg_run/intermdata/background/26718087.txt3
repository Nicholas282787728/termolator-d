Anthraquinone-steroids, evanthrasterol A and B, and a meroterpenoid, emericellic acid, from endophytic fungus, Emericella variecolor
Two new anthraquinone-steroids, evanthrasterol A and B (1 and 2), and a new meroterpenoid, emericellic acid (3), together with six known compounds (4-9) were isolated from an endophytic fungus, Emericella variecolor. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis (1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS and FTIR). Herein emericellic acid (3) is a new skeleton of meroterpenoid with carboxylic functional group at C-9' and this is the first report on isolation of anthraquinone-steroids from E. variecolor.
