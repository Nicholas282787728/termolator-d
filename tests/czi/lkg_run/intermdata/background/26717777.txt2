Spectral Calibration of Space-born Imaging Spectrometers Using Spectrum-Matching Technique
Spectral calibration of space-born imaging spectrometers based on spectrum-matching technique is presented, which adopts atmospheric absorption lines as the matching lines, and chooses correlation coefficient method as the criteria. In order to simulation the onboard spectral calibration, the spectrum-matching technique is applied on the imaging spectrometers that after the vibration test. The vibration test is able to simulation the launching. The spectral resolution, center wavelength of two-dimensional pixel is determined during onboard spectral calibration. As the calibration results show, the spectral resolution of imaging spectrometers after the vibration test is 0.40 nm, it is the same comparing to the value before the vibration, the wavelength shifts 0.08 nm towards the long wave for the spectral pixels, and the spectral smile is determined for all spatial elements, which shifts towards the short wave direction, with the max smile value is 0.96 nm, the result is similar to that before the vibration. As a result, the spectrum-matching technique is tested and verified.
