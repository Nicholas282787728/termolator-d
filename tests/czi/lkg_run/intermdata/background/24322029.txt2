In vivo behavior of surface modified Ti6Al7Nb alloys used in selective laser melting for custom-made implants. A preliminary study
The objectives of this study were to test the biocompatibility and to evaluate the osseointegration of Titanium-Aluminum-Niobium (Ti6Al7Nb) alloy used in the manufacturing of personalized implants with selective laser melting (SLM) technology and to compare the growth viability of osteoblastic-like cells on different Ti6Al7Nb alloy samples (plain, coated with hydroxyapatite or SiO2-TiO2) implanted into the cranial bone of Wistar rats. In terms of biocompatibility, the cone-beam computer-tomography head scans taken at the moment of sacrifice of each group (one, two and three months) showed no implant displacement, no osteolysis and no liquid collection around the implants. At one month, around all types of implants new bone formation was noticed, although around the plain Ti6Al7Nb implant a large amount of powder debris was present. Still, no inflammatory reaction was seen. At two months, the distance between the implants and the calvarial bone margins diminished. A thin layer of fibrous tissue was noticed around the Ti6Al7Nb implant coated with hydroxyapatite but no bone contact was achieved. In the group sacrificed at three months there was still no bone contact, but noticeable were the SiO2-TiO2. In the group sacrificed at three months SiO2-TiO2 particles detached from the implant and completely integrated in the tissue were noticeable. All results suggested that the Ti6Al7Nb alloy with or without infiltration is well biologically tolerated.
