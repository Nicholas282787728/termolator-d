Intermittent hypoxia: a low-risk research tool with therapeutic value in humans
Intermittent hypoxia has generally been perceived as a high-risk stimulus, particularly in the field of sleep medicine, because it is thought to initiate detrimental cardiovascular, respiratory, cognitive, and metabolic outcomes. In contrast, the link between intermittent hypoxia and beneficial outcomes has received less attention, perhaps because it is not universally understood that outcome measures following exposure to intermittent hypoxia may be linked to the administered dose. The present review is designed to emphasize the less recognized beneficial outcomes associated with intermittent hypoxia. The review will consider the role intermittent hypoxia has in cardiovascular and autonomic adaptations, respiratory motor plasticity, and cognitive function. Each section will highlight the literature that contributed to the belief that intermittent hypoxia leads primarily to detrimental outcomes. The second segment of each section will consider the possible risks associated with experimentally rather than naturally induced intermittent hypoxia. Finally, the body of literature indicating that intermittent hypoxia initiates primarily beneficial outcomes will be considered. The overarching theme of the review is that the use of intermittent hypoxia in research investigations, coupled with reasonable safeguards, should be encouraged because of the potential benefits linked to the administration of a variety of low-risk intermittent hypoxia protocols.
