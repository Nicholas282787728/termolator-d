Denosumab - a new option in the treatment of osteoporosis
Denosumab is the international name of a human, monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. This antibody is associated with RANK ligand (RANKL), inactivating it. In consequence, the formation and survival of osteoclasts are suppressed, leading to their apoptosis. All this results in lower bone resorption, while bone mineral density (BMD) increases. Denosumab also reduces the risk of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. This agent is similarly effective in various stages of renal function impairment; it does not impair fracture healing processes nor contribute to atherosclerosis progression in patients with high cardiovascular risks. Following an analysis of adverse effects, performed in the FREEDOM study (in which it was demonstrated that the incidence of the majority of adverse effects observed in the course of denosumab use was similar to that in the placebo group), its safety for patients can definitely be confirmed.
