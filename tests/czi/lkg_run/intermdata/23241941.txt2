Idiopathic juxtafoveal retinal telangiectasis and retinal macroaneurysm treated with indocyanine green dye-enhanced photocoagulation
This case report presents the use of indocyanine green dye-enhanced photocoagulation (ICG-DEP) for the treatment of idiopathic juxtafoveal retinal telangiectasis and a retinal macroaneurysm. A 35-year-old male with 20/20 vision had been followed for 5 years for a retinal macroaneurysm with retinal telangiectasis outside the macular area. He then presented with a recently decreased vision in his right. He had macular edema with a new area of idiopathic juxtafoveal retinal telangiectasis. After 4 focal argon laser treatments, angiographic closure of the lesions was not obtained and the retinal edema remained. After 3 sessions of ICG-DEP, the lesions were closed and the edema absorbed. The 810 nm infrared laser with ICG-DEP should be considered for the treatment of idiopathic juxtafoveal retinal telangiectasis and retinal macroaneurysms. In this case the procedure appears to be safe and well tolerated. It may allow for more direct energy absorption than that of the argon laser to these types of retinal lesions with better tissue closure.
