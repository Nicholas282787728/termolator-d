Study review of biological, social and environmental factors associated with aggressive behavior
To study the risk factors related to the development of aggressive behavior. A search was carried out in two electronic databases, Medline and SciElo by retrospective studies, longitudinal and review that assessed risk factors for the development of aggressive behavior. There were selected 11 longitudinal studies (8 prospective and 3 case-control studies) and a cross sectional study that evaluated the risk factors and socio-biological related to aggressive behavior. Five studies have evaluated gene expression, five evaluated exposure to tobacco, alcohol and cocaine in the prenatal period, one evaluated the effect of early malnutrition on the development of aggressive behavior and one assessed the impact of child maltreatment. The main biological factors were: genetic (low expression of the monoamine oxidase gene and serotonin transporter gene, variations in transporter and dopamine receptor genes), exposure to substances during intrauterine development (tobacco, alcohol and cocaine) and nutrition (malnutrition). The main environmental factors were: child abuse, poverty, crime and antisocial behavior in childhood, while the highest level of evidence was related to early neglect. The interaction between biological and environmental factors can be catalyzed by a hostile environment, increasing the risk for the development of aggressive behavior.
