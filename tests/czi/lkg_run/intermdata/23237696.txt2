OPTN/SRTR 2011 Annual Data Report: pancreas
Numbers of pancreas transplants have been decreasing over the past decade, but outcomes continue to improve for all types: simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant, pancreas after kidney transplant (PAK), and pancreas transplant alone (PTA). The most notable decrease occurred for PAK transplants, possibly due in part to decreases in numbers of living donor kidney transplants. The number of new candidates on the pancreas transplant waiting list has decreased steadily since 2000; only 1005 active candidates were added in 2011. Transplant rates for all pancreas transplant types reached a low in 2011 of 34.9 transplants per 100 wait-list years. Deceased donation rates have also been decreasing since 2005, but use of donation after circulatory death has been gradually increasing. The discard rate in 2011 was 27.7%, and higher for pancreata recovered from older donors. Improved outcomes during the early posttransplant period largely reflect improved donor and recipient selection and improved technical strategies. Inconsistent definitions of graft failure across reporting centers creates an ongoing challenge in the interpretation of outcome data for pancreas transplants. Rates of posttransplant re-hospitalization are high, most occurring in the first 6 months. Rejection rates are highest for PTA recipients, who also experience higher incidence of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.
