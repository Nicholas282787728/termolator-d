(210)Bi - from interference to advantage in (210)Pb determination with liquid scintillation counter
A novel method for determination of (210)Pb activity concentration using a liquid scintillation counter (LSC) in environmental samples is presented. After radiochemical separation of (210)Pb on Eichrom Sr Resin column, the decay product (210)Bi starts to in-grow and interfere with the (210)Pb during measurement with LSC. Instead of eliminating this interference, a novel method utilises (210)Bi in-growth to improve the detection efficiency and subsequently to lower the minimum detectable activity (MDA). This allows for substantial reduction of the MDA compared to conventional methods.
