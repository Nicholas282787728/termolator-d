An adverse event continuous surveillance system in surgical services of the autonomous region of Cantabria (Spain)
To design a continuous surveillance system for adverse events (AEs) in surgical services in the Autonomous Community of Cantabria. Through homogeneous methodology, this system will provide the information needed to prevent and control AEs and avoid their recurrence. We performed a prospective study of the population undergoing inpatient surgery in our service. The methodology used was an adapted version of the IDEA (Identification of Adverse Events) project. Surgeons had access to an intranet website and introduced the data by using a personal login. A web application allowed feedback through report-generation. During the pilot phase, limited collection of variables requiring calculations and of those related to location and causality was observed. Assessment of the system indicated the need for simplification to obtain valid and useful information, as well as the need to provide help windows. The system was redesigned with two data input screens and currently allows for automatic report generation of registered AEs. Information was gathered on 70% of the patients and an incidence of 11.2 AEs/100 admissions was found. Of these, 47% were defined as surgical complications. Establishing a continuous surveillance system for AEs is feasible if professionals participate in the process, data input is easy and feedback from the system is rapid and useful for implementing corrective measures. This system can be considered highly useful for obtaining information on AEs and consequently on the potential areas of improvement in surgical activity in Spanish hospitals.
