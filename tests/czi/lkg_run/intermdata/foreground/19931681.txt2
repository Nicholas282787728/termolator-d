Cutaneous immune system
Human skin is constantly exposed to environmental factors. It does not only function as a physical barrier but also exhibits the capacity to generate innate and adaptative immune responses. So, the skin protect the host from microbial and chemical insults. However, it may also develop an immune response against malignant cells. Cutaneous immunity can be controlled by some factors such as ageing, ultraviolet irradiation, topical therapies.
