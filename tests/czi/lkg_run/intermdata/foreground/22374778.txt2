Cognitive evoked potentials and executive functions in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Cognitive evoked potentials (P300) have been core of interest in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) research. The identification of its relationship with the most ecological aspects of executive dysfunction involves a link between neurophysiological and functional frames for a better treatment approach and monitoring of the evolution of the disorder. To explore the differences in latency and amplitude of P300 component in Cz, Fz and Pz, between ADHD and no-ADHD children, and to analyze the correlations between variables of P300 and indexes of a measurement of executive functioning at home. Two groups were performed: an ADHD group of 16 children with a diagnosis of combined ADHD; and a group of 8 children without ADHD. Cognitive event-related potentials (P300) were registered and analyzed in an auditory and a visual modality. In addition, fathers fulfilled an executive behavior scale -Behavior Rating Inventory for Executive Function (BRIEF)-. RESULTS. The differences between the ADHD and the control group were significant, in visual and auditory latencies and in visual amplitudes. Significant correlations were found between some variables of P300 component and the BRIEF subscales. These results remark the utility of cognitive evoked potentials for the executive dysfunction in ADHD research, and emphasize the necessity of keeping the clinical assessment in diagnosis and monitoring of these children.
