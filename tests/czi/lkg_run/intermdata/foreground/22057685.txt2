Patients with isolated prolonged in vitro bleeding time. Clinical symptoms
In patients with isolated prolonged in vitro bleeding time there is no standardised treatment concept. With this study we characterized the extent of bleeding symptoms. All diagnoses known to cause prolonged in vitro bleeding time (PFA-100) (epinephrine-cartridge >160 s, ADP-cartridge > 120 s) have been excluded, such as platelet function disorders, effects of medications, nutrition or von Willebrand disease. 75 patients (77%, n = 58 women; 23%, n = 17 men, median age 46 (16-81) years were included. All bleeding symptoms have been stored in a databank with help of a comprehensive questionnaire. 78% (n = 54) of all patients reported of having had an operation, 69.8% (n = 37) of them described postoperative bleedings (p = 0.0373). 13.5% (n = 5) of the 54 could remember having been randomly treated by the administration of a transfusion and only 2.7% (n = 1) were treated by substitution of von Willebrand factor. 71% (n = 51) patients indicated haematoma (p = 0.8116). About 33.8% (n = 24) patients had gum bleeding and 40.8% (n = 29, p = 0.7808) patients reported bleeding after the dentist. 41.4% (n = 29) patients suffered under frequent epistaxis (p = 0.0212). There was no correlation between prolonged epinephrine bleeding time to VWF:Ag (rho = 0.16) nor to VWF:RCo (rho = 0.12) nor between prolonged epinephrine and ADP bleeding time (rho = 0.01) nor to ROTEMÂ® analysis. Patients with isolated prolonged PFA are mainly women and can be affected by all kinds of bleedings while haematoma is the main symptom. VWD might not be causal.
