Tools for addressing systems issues in transition
Moving from pediatric to adult healthcare is a time of stress and opportunity for adolescents with special healthcare needs (ASHCN) and their families. With over 90% of children with special healthcare needs surviving into young adulthood, there is an increasing imperative to actively engage youth in preparing for the adult system (Betz and Smith 2011; Pai and Schwartz 2011). The goal of transition care is to provide young people with a coordinated, uninterrupted and developmentally appropriate transfer to adult healthcare (Kaufman and Pinzon 2007). This is often complicated by the complex medical, social and psychological tasks and requirements that adolescents experience as they navigate their healthcare and their lives as young, developing people.
