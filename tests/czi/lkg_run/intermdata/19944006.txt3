An evidence based overview of sublingual immunotherapy in children
In light of the current evidence, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) can be suggested for use in pediatric allergic rhinitis and asthma as treatment and preventive management. Sublingual specific immunotherapy (SLIT) can be suggested for use in children with allergic rhino-conjunctivitis, and seasonal asthma, especially if they are mono-sensitive, for a duration of no less than three years. The earlier treatment begins, the better is the outcome. Further randomized, long-term trials in SLIT for the treatment of perennial asthmatic children are still needed. As regards the choice between the methods of administration (the traditional SCIT or the innovative SLIT), it is up to the physician to find the right equilibrium in the single patient.
