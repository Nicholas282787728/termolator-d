Cancer Health Disparities. The term cancer health disparities describes the unequal burden of cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality in different population groups. By and large, the higher burden of cancer is observed in racial or ethnic minorities, immigrant communities, inner city populations, and insular, rural, or otherwise geographically isolated populations. In rare instances, however, the majority Caucasian population suffers a higher burden of cancer, e.g., melanoma. There are multiple and overlapping causes for cancer health disparities, including genetic make up, cultural norms and beliefs, behavior, environmental factors, as well as social aspects such as socio-economic status, poverty, and education. Reducing cancer health disparities is an important and integral component of the nation's effort to improve the health of all Americans. The science of cancer health disparities aims to better understand the causes of health disparities and to develop better means of prevention, diagnosis, and therapy, although some of the social aspects of cancer health disparities may be beyond the reach of the biomedical community.
