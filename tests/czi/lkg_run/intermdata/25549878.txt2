Using a community-based participatory research approach to evaluate resident predictors of involuntary exit from permanent supportive housing
The aim of this study was to determine an association between resident characteristics at time of entry to permanent supportive housing and exit status. A community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach was the guiding framework for the design, implementation and evaluation of this project. This retrospective observational study used an administrative data source from a local permanent supportive housing provider to compare resident characteristics among those who left housing voluntarily or involuntarily. The population based sample (n=407) was comprised of 51% males and 47% African-Americans with a mean age of 40 years (SD=11.8). Involuntary exits (IEs) occurred in 40% of the sample (n=166). IE was less likely with receipt of mainstream benefits, compared to employment income (O.R.=.546, p=.032). IE was more likely for residents self-identifying as African-American (O.R.=1.56, p=.037) and when children resided in the household (O.R.=2.03, p=.013). Despite limitations of community-derived data, findings suggest that supportive housing providers consider income source and family status when designing interventions to decrease IEs. A CBPR approach is a promising framework to guide evaluation efforts for supportive housing programs.
