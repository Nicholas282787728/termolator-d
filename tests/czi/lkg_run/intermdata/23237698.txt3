OPTN/SRTR 2011 Annual Data Report: intestine
Since 2006, the number of new intestinal transplant candidates listed each year has declined, likely reflecting increased medical and surgical treatment for intestinal failure. Historically, intestinal transplant occurred primarily in the pediatric population; in 2011, 41% of prevalent candidates on the waiting list were aged 18 years or older. The most common etiology of intestinal failure remains short-gut syndrome, which encompasses several diagnoses. The proportion of candidates with high medical urgency status decreased and time on the waiting list increased in 2011. The overall rate of transplant decreased from a peak of 92.7 transplants per 100 wait-list years in 2005 to 49.2 in 2011. The number of intestines recovered and transplanted per donor has decreased since 2007, possibly due to fewer listed patients. Almost 50% of deceased donor intestines were transplanted with another organ in 2011. Historically, the most common organ transplanted with the intestine was the liver, but in 2011 it was the pancreas. Graft survival has continued to improve over the past decade, and the number of recipients alive with a functioning intestinal graft has steadily increased since 1998. Hospitalization is common, occurring in 84.8% of recipients by 6 months posttransplant and in almost all by 4 years.
